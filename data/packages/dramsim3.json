    "description": "DRAMsim3 models the timing paramaters and memory controller behavior for\nseveral DRAM protocols such as DDR3, DDR4, LPDDR3, LPDDR4, GDDR5, GDDR6,\nHBM, HMC, STT-MRAM. It is implemented in C++ as an objected oriented\nmodel that includes a parameterized DRAM bank model, DRAM controllers,\ncommand queues and system-level interfaces to interact with a CPU\nsimulator (GEM5, ZSim) or trace workloads. It is designed to be\naccurate, portable and parallel.\n",
