The core of the package implements a framework for\nperforming fully customized requests where data can be processed either\nin memory, on disk, or streaming via the callback or connection\ninterfaces. Some knowledge of libcurl is recommended; for a more-user-\nfriendly web client see the 'httr' package which builds on this package\nwith http specific tools and logic.",

Started out as\na fork of 'RJSONIO', but has been completely rewritten in recent\nversions. The package offers flexible, robust, high performance tools\nfor working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful for building\npipelines and interacting with a web API. The implementation is based on\nthe mapping described in the vignette (Ooms, 2014). In addition to\nconverting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to\nstream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with\nthe package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded\nconsistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.",
