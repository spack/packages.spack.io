    "description": "Truncated Multivariate Normal Simulation. Importance sampling from the\ntruncated multivariate normal using the GHK (Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane)\nsimulator. Unlike Gibbs sampling which can get stuck in one truncation\nsub-region depending on initial values, this package allows truncation\nbased on disjoint regions that are created by truncation of absolute\nvalues. The GHK algorithm uses simple Cholesky transformation followed\nby recursive simulation of univariate truncated normals hence there are\nalso no convergence issues. Importance sample is returned along with\nsampling weights, based on which, one can calculate integrals over\ntruncated regions for multivariate normals.\n",
