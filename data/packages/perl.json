MAKER is also easily trainable: outputs of preliminary\nruns can be used to automatically retrain its gene prediction algorithm,\nproducing higher quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs\nare minimal and its ouputs can be directly loaded into a GMOD database.\nThey can also be viewed in the Apollo genome browser; this feature of\nMAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view and edit individual\ncontigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. MAKER should prove\nespecially useful for emerging model organism projects with minimal\nbioinformatics expertise and computer resources. Note: MAKER requires\nregistration.

It's possible since perl 5.8.1 to\nglobally disable this feature by using the PERL_SIGNALS environment\nvariables (as specified in \"PERL_SIGNALS\" in perlrun); but there's no\nway to disable it locally, for a short period of time. That's however\nsomething you might want to do, if, for example, your Perl program calls\na C routine that will potentially run for a long time and for which you\nwant to set a timeout.

For\nthis reason it has always been recommended that one do as little as\npossible in a signal handler, and only variables that already exist be\nmanipulated. Perl 5.8.0 and later versions implements 'safe' signal\nhandling on platforms which support the POSIX sigaction() function. This\nis accomplished by having perl note that a signal has arrived, but\ndeferring the execution of the signal handler until such time as it is\nsafe to do so. Unfortunately these changes can break some existing\nscripts, if they depended on a system routine being interrupted by the\nsignal's arrival. The perl 5.8.0 implementation was modified further in\nversion 5.8.2",
