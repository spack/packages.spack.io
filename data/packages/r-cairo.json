    "description": "R graphics device using cairo graphics library for creating high-quality\nbitmap (PNG, JPEG, TIFF), vector (PDF, SVG, PostScript) and display (X11\nand Win32) output. R graphics device using cairographics library that\ncan be used to create high-quality vector (PDF, PostScript and SVG) and\nbitmap output (PNG,JPEG,TIFF), and high-quality rendering in displays\n(X11 and Win32). Since it uses the same back-end for all output, copying\nacross formats is WYSIWYG. Files are created without the dependence on\nX11 or other external programs. This device supports alpha channel\n(semi-transparent drawing) and resulting images can contain transparent\nand semi-transparent regions. It is ideal for use in server environments\n(file output) and as a replacement for other devices that don't have\nCairo's capabilities such as alpha support or anti-aliasing. Backends\nare modular such that any subset of backends is supported.\n",

The\npackage wraps 'CImg', <https://cimg.eu/>, a simple, modern C++ library\nfor image processing."
