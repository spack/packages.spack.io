    "description": "Efficient Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation and WAIC for BayesianModels.\nEfficient approximate leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) for Bayesian\nmodels fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo, as described in Vehtari,\nGelman, and Gabry (2017) <doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9696-4>. The\napproximation uses Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new\nprocedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of the\ncalculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated\npredictive errors and for the comparison of predictive errors between\nmodels. The package also provides methods for using stacking and other\nmodel weighting techniques to average Bayesian predictive distributions.\n",

In addition, all parameters of the response\ndistribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional\nregression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage\nusers to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.\nModel fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive\nchecks and leave-one-out cross-validation.
