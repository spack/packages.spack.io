The NVIDIA HPC SDK C, C++, and\nFortran compilers support GPU acceleration of HPC modeling and\nsimulation applications with standard C++ and Fortran, OpenACC\ndirectives, and CUDA. GPU-accelerated math libraries maximize\nperformance on common HPC algorithms, and optimized communications\nlibraries enable standards-based multi-GPU and scalable systems\nprogramming. Performance profiling and debugging tools simplify porting\nand optimization of HPC applications.",

It is able to simulate diploid genomes with SNPs and\ninsertion/deletion (INDEL) polymorphisms, and simulate reads with\nuniform substitution sequencing errors. It does not generate INDEL\nsequencing errors, but this can be partly compensated by simulating\nINDEL polymorphisms.\n",
