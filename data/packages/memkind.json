Memory characteristics supported by memkind\nwithout user extension include control of NUMA and page size features.\nThe jemalloc non-standard interface has been extended to enable\nspecialized arenas to make requests for virtual memory from the\noperating system through the memkind partition interface. Through the\nother memkind interfaces the user can control and extend memory\npartition features and allocate memory while selecting enabled features.\n",
