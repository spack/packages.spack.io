The NVIDIA HPC SDK C, C++, and\nFortran compilers support GPU acceleration of HPC modeling and\nsimulation applications with standard C++ and Fortran, OpenACC\ndirectives, and CUDA. GPU-accelerated math libraries maximize\nperformance on common HPC algorithms, and optimized communications\nlibraries enable standards-based multi-GPU and scalable systems\nprogramming. Performance profiling and debugging tools simplify porting\nand optimization of HPC applications.",

NLopt is a free/open-source library for nonlinear\noptimization, providing a common interface for a number of different\nfree optimization routines available online as well as original\nimplementations of various other algorithms. See\n<https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Algorithms/> for more\ninformation on the available algorithms. Building from included sources\nrequires 'CMake'. On Linux and 'macOS', if a suitable system build of\nNLopt (2.7.0 or later) is found, it is used; otherwise, it is built from\nincluded sources via 'CMake'. On Windows, NLopt is obtained through\n'rwinlib' for 'R <= 4.1.x' or grabbed from the 'Rtools42 toolchain' for\n'R >= 4.2.0'.",

An efficient C++\nbased implementation of the 'DEoptim' function which performs global\noptimization by differential evolution. Its creation was motivated by\ntrying to see if the old approximation \"easier, shorter, faster: pick\nany two\" could in fact be extended to achieving all three goals while\nmoving the code from plain old C to modern C++. The initial version did\nin fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to an implicit code\nreview which eliminated a few inefficiencies which have since been\neliminated in 'DEoptim'.",

The\nalgorithm searches for an optimal polynomial describing the warping. It\nis possible to align one sample to a reference, several samples to the\nsame reference, or several samples to several references. One can choose\nbetween calculating individual warpings, or one global warping for a set\nof samples and one reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented:\nRMS (Root Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both\nwarping of peak profiles and of peak lists are supported. A vignette for\nthe latter is contained in the inst/doc directory of the source package\n- the vignette source can be found on the package github site.\n",
