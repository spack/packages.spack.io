In addition, all parameters of the response\ndistribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional\nregression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage\nusers to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.\nModel fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive\nchecks and leave-one-out cross-validation.
