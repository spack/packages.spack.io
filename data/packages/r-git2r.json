These files are not handled by\ngit in any way, but instead are uploaded, downloaded, or edited directly\nby calls through the GitHub API. These data files can be versioned\nmanually by creating different releases. This approach works equally\nwell with public or private repositories. Data can be uploaded and\ndownloaded programmatically from scripts. No authentication is required\nto download data from public repositories.",
