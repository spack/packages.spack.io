Implements\na James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator for the covariance matrix, with\nseparate shrinkage for variances and correlations. The details of the\nmethod are explained in Schafer and Strimmer (2005)\n<DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1175> and Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007)\n<DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1252>. The approach is both computationally as\nwell as statistically very efficient, it is applicable to \"small n,\nlarge p\" data, and always returns a positive definite and well-\nconditioned covariance matrix. In addition to inferring the covariance\nmatrix the package also provides shrinkage estimators for partial\ncorrelations and partial variances. The inverse of the covariance and\ncorrelation matrix can be efficiently computed, as well as any arbitrary\npower of the shrinkage correlation matrix. Furthermore, functions are\navailable for fast singular value decomposition, for computing the\npseudoinverse, and for checking the rank and positive definiteness of a\nmatrix.",

The central\nalgorithm is Fisher scoring and iterative reweighted least squares. At\nthe heart of this package are the vector generalized linear and additive\nmodel (VGLM/VGAM) classes. VGLMs can be loosely thought of as\nmultivariate GLMs. VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs that use smoothing. The\nbook \"Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models: With an\nImplementation in R\" (Yee, 2015) <DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7> gives\ndetails of the statistical framework and the package. Currently only\nfixed-effects models are implemented. Many (150+) models and\ndistributions are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or\npenalized MLE. The other classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs),\nquadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column interaction\nmodels)---these classes perform constrained and unconstrained quadratic\nordination (CQO/UQO) models in ecology, as well as constrained additive\nordination (CAO). Hauck-Donner effect detection is implemented. Note\nthat these functions are subject to change; see the NEWS and ChangeLog\nfiles for latest changes.",
