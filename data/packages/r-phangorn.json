Finally, there are a number of\nfunctions for reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating, and\nmanipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative data not covered by\nother packages. For instance, there are functions for randomly or non-\nrandomly attaching species or clades to a phylogeny, for estimating\nsupertrees or consensus phylogenies from a set, for simulating trees and\nphylogenetic data under a range of models, and for a wide variety of\nother manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic biologists might find\nuseful in their research."
