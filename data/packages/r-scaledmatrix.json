Wrapping an array-like object (typically an on-disk\nobject) in a DelayedArray object allows one to perform common array\noperations on it without loading the object in memory. In order to\nreduce memory usage and optimize performance, operations on the object\nare either delayed or executed using a block processing mechanism. Note\nthat this also works on in-memory array-like objects like DataFrame\nobjects (typically with Rle columns), Matrix objects, and ordinary\narrays and data frames.",
