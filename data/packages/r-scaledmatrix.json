The result is\nequivalent to using the scale() function but avoids explicit realization\nof a dense matrix during block processing. This permits greater\nefficiency in common operations, most notably matrix multiplication.\n",

The\nS4Vectors package defines the Vector and List virtual classes and a set\nof generic functions that extend the semantic of ordinary vectors and\nlists in R. Package developers can easily implement vector-like or list-\nlike objects as concrete subclasses of Vector or List. In addition, a\nfew low-level concrete subclasses of general interest (e.g. DataFrame,\nRle, and Hits) are implemented in the S4Vectors package itself (many\nmore are implemented in the IRanges package and in other Bioconductor\ninfrastructure packages)."

Wrapping an array-like object (typically an on-disk\nobject) in a DelayedArray object allows one to perform common array\noperations on it without loading the object in memory. In order to\nreduce memory usage and optimize performance, operations on the object\nare either delayed or executed using a block processing mechanism. Note\nthat this also works on in-memory array-like objects like DataFrame\nobjects (typically with Rle columns), Matrix objects, and ordinary\narrays and data frames."
