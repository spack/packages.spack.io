Commonly this is shown by a bracket\non top connecting the groups of interest which itself is annotated with\nthe level of significance (NS, *, **, ***). The package provides a\nsingle layer (geom_signif()) that takes the groups for comparison and\nthe test (t.test(), wilcox.text() etc.) as arguments and adds the\nannotation to the plot.\n",
