Each variable has its own imputation model.\nBuilt-in imputation models are provided for continuous data (predictive\nmean matching, normal), binary data (logistic regression), unordered\ncategorical data (polytomous logistic regression) and ordered\ncategorical data (proportional odds). MICE can also impute continuous\ntwo-level data (normal model, pan, second-level variables). Passive\nimputation can be used to maintain consistency between variables.\nVarious diagnostic plots are available to inspect the quality of the\nimputations."
