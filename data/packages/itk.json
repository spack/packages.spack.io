The Insight Toolkit (ITK) is an open-source, cross-\nplatform toolkit for N-dimensional scientific image processing,\nsegmentation, and registration. Segmentation is the process of\nidentifying and classifying data found in a digitally sampled\nrepresentation. Typically the sampled representation is an image\nacquired from such medical instrumentation as CT or MRI scanners.\nRegistration is the task of aligning or developing correspondences\nbetween data. For example, in the medical environment, a CT scan may be\naligned with a MRI scan in order to combine the information contained in\nboth.\n",
