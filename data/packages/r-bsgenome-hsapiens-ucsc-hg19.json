The\nnormalization model in CODEX includes terms that specifically remove\nbiases due to GC content, exon length and targeting and amplification\nefficiency, and latent systemic artifacts. CODEX also includes a Poisson\nlikelihood-based recursive segmentation procedure that explicitly models\nthe count-based exome sequencing data."
