It provides methods for fast and memory efficient\nparsing of Affymetrix files using the Affymetrix' Fusion SDK. Both\nASCII- and binary-based files are supported. Currently, there are\nmethods for reading chip definition file (CDF) and a cell intensity file\n(CEL). These files can be read either in full or in part. For example,\nprobe signals from a few probesets can be extracted very quickly from a\nset of CEL files into a convenient list structure.\n",
