Password\nentry can be invoked in two different ways: directly from R via the\naskpass() function, or indirectly as password-entry back-end for 'ssh-\nagent' or 'git-credential' via the SSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS\nenvironment variables. Thereby the user can be prompted for credentials\nor a passphrase if needed when R calls out to git or ssh."

For SSH remotes we provide\nconvenient functions to find or generate appropriate SSH keys. The\npackage both helps the user to setup a local git installation, and also\nprovides a back-end for git/ssh client libraries to authenticate with\nexisting user credentials."
