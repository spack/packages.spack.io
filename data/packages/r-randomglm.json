Foreach is an idiom that allows for iterating over elements\nin a collection, without the use of an explicit loop counter. This\npackage in particular is intended to be used for its return value,\nrather than for its side effects. In that sense, it is similar to the\nstandard lapply function, but doesn't require the evaluation of a\nfunction. Using foreach without side effects also facilitates executing\nthe loop in parallel.",

Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations,\nhalfspace intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site\nDelaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It runs in\n2D, 3D, 4D, and higher dimensions. It implements the Quickhull algorithm\nfor computing the convex hull. Qhull does not support constrained\nDelaunay triangulations, or mesh generation of non-convex objects, but\nthe package does include some R functions that allow for this.",
