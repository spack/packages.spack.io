The package\nABAEnrichment is designed to test for enrichment of user defined\ncandidate genes in the set of expressed genes in different human brain\nregions.

'aba_enrich' interfaces the ontology enrichment\nsoftware FUNC to perform the statistical analyses. Additional functions\nprovided in this package like 'get_expression' and 'plot_expression'\nfacilitate exploring the expression data, and besides the standard\ncandidate vs. background gene set enrichment, also three additional\ntests are implemented, e.g. for cases when genes are ranked instead of\ndivided into candidate and background.",
