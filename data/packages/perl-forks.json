The\nreason it is consider unsafe, is that there is a risk that a signal will\narrive, and be handled while perl is changing internal data structures.\nThis can result in all kinds of subtle and not so subtle problems. For\nthis reason it has always been recommended that one do as little as\npossible in a signal handler, and only variables that already exist be\nmanipulated. Perl 5.8.0 and later versions implements 'safe' signal\nhandling on platforms which support the POSIX sigaction() function. This\nis accomplished by having perl note that a signal has arrived, but\ndeferring the execution of the signal handler until such time as it is\nsafe to do so. Unfortunately these changes can break some existing\nscripts, if they depended on a system routine being interrupted by the\nsignal's arrival. The perl 5.8.0 implementation was modified further in\nversion 5.8.2",

            "description": "MAKER is a portable and easily configurable genome annotation pipeline.\nIt's purpose is to allow smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic\ngenomeprojects to independently annotate their genomes and to create\ngenome databases. MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to\na genome, produces ab-initio gene predictions and automatically\nsynthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based\nquality values. MAKER is also easily trainable: outputs of preliminary\nruns can be used to automatically retrain its gene prediction algorithm,\nproducing higher quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs\nare minimal and its ouputs can be directly loaded into a GMOD database.\nThey can also be viewed in the Apollo genome browser; this feature of\nMAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view and edit individual\ncontigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. MAKER should prove\nespecially useful for emerging model organism projects with minimal\nbioinformatics expertise and computer resources. Note: MAKER requires\nregistration.
