Its search heuristic is based on\niteratively performing a series of Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR)\nmoves, which allows to quickly navigate to the best-known ML tree.\nRAxML-NG is a successor of RAxML (Stamatakis 2014) and leverages the\nhighly optimized likelihood computation implemented in libpll (Flouri et\nal. 2014).\n",
