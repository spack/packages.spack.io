    "description": "Spack compiler wrapper script. Compiler commands go through this\ncompiler wrapper in Spack builds. The compiler wrapper is a thin layer\naround the standard compilers. It enables several key pieces of\nfunctionality: 1. It allows Spack to swap compilers into and out of\nbuilds easily. 2. It adds several options to the compile line so that\nspack packages can find their dependencies at build time and run time:\n-I and/or -isystem arguments for dependency /include directories. -L\narguments for dependency /lib directories. -Wl,-rpath arguments for\ndependency /lib directories. 3. It provides a mechanism to inject flags\nfrom specs\n",
