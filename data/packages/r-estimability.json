Provides tools\nfor determining estimability of linear functions of regression\ncoefficients, and 'epredict' methods that handle non-estimable cases\ncorrectly. Estimability theory is discussed in many linear-models\ntextbooks including Chapter 3 of Monahan, JF (2008), \"A Primer on Linear\nModels\", Chapman and Hall (ISBN 978-1-4200-6201-4).\n",
