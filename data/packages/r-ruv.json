The normalisation procedure is subset-quantile within-array\nnormalisation (SWAN), which allows Infinium I and II type probes on a\nsingle array to be normalised together. The test for differential\nvariability is based on an empirical Bayes version of Levene's test.\nDifferential methylation testing is performed using RUV, which can\nadjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in high-dimensional data\nby using negative control probes. Gene ontology analysis is performed by\ntaking into account the number of probes per gene on the array, as well\nas taking into account multi-gene associated probes.",

These algorithms\nattempt to adjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in high-\ndimensional data. The algorithms were originally developed for use with\ngenomic data, especially microarray data, but may be useful with other\ntypes of high-dimensional data as well. These algorithms were proposed\nin Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed (2012) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkz433>, Gagnon-\nBartsch, Jacob and Speed (2013), and Molania, et. al. (2019)\n<doi:10.1093/nar/gkz433>. The algorithms require the user to specify a\nset of negative control variables, as described in the references. The\nalgorithms included in this package are 'RUV-2', 'RUV-4', 'RUV-inv',\n'RUV-rinv', 'RUV-I', and RUV-III', along with various supporting\nalgorithms.\n",
