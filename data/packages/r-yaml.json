Specifically, checkpoint allows you to\ninstall packages as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as\nif you had a CRAN time machine. To achieve reproducibility, the\ncheckpoint() function installs the packages required or called by your\nproject and scripts to a local library exactly as they existed at the\nspecified point in time. Only those packages are available to your\nproject, thereby avoiding any package updates that came later and may\nhave altered your results. In this way, anyone using checkpoint's\ncheckpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects\nat any time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight\nUTC) Microsoft refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the \"Microsoft R\nArchived Network\" server (<https://mran.microsoft.com/>). Immediately\nafter completion of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a\nsnapshot, thus creating the archive. Snapshot archives exist starting\nfrom 2014-09-17.",
