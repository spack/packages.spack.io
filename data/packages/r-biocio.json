The `import()` interface optionally\nprovides a standard mechanism for 'lazy' access via `filter()` (on row\nor element-like components of the file resource), `select()` (on column-\nlike components of the file resource) and `collect()`. The `import()`\ninterface optionally provides transparent access to remote (e.g. via\nhttps) as well as local access. Developers can register a file\nextension, e.g., `.loom` for dispatch from character-based URIs to\nspecific `import()` / `export()` methods based on classes representing\nfile types, e.g., `LoomFile()`.\n",
