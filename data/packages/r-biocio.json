    "description": "Standard Input and Output for Bioconductor Packages. Implements\n`import()` and `export()` standard generics for importing and exporting\nbiological data formats. `import()` supports whole-file as well as\nchunk-wise iterative import. The `import()` interface optionally\nprovides a standard mechanism for 'lazy' access via `filter()` (on row\nor element-like components of the file resource), `select()` (on column-\nlike components of the file resource) and `collect()`. The `import()`\ninterface optionally provides transparent access to remote (e.g. via\nhttps) as well as local access. Developers can register a file\nextension, e.g., `.loom` for dispatch from character-based URIs to\nspecific `import()` / `export()` methods based on classes representing\nfile types, e.g., `LoomFile()`.\n",

Package developers can easily implement vector-like or list-\nlike objects as concrete subclasses of Vector or List. In addition, a\nfew low-level concrete subclasses of general interest (e.g. DataFrame,\nRle, and Hits) are implemented in the S4Vectors package itself (many\nmore are implemented in the IRanges package and in other Bioconductor\ninfrastructure packages)."
