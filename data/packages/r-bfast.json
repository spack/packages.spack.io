    "description": "Breaks for Additive Season and Trend. Decomposition of time series into\ntrend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting and\ncharacterizing abrupt changes within the trend and seasonal components.\n'BFAST' can be used to analyze different types of satellite image time\nseries and can be applied to other disciplines dealing with seasonal or\nnon-seasonal time series, such as hydrology, climatology, and\neconometrics. The algorithm can be extended to label detected changes\nwith information on the parameters of the fitted piecewise linear\nmodels. 'BFAST' monitoring functionality is described in Verbesselt et\nal. (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.rse.2009.08.014>. 'BFAST monitor' provides\nfunctionality to detect disturbance in near real-time based on 'BFAST'-\ntype models, and is described in Verbesselt et al. (2012)\n<doi:10.1016/j.rse.2012.02.022>. 'BFAST Lite' approach is a flexible\napproach that handles missing data without interpolation, and will be\ndescribed in an upcoming paper. Furthermore, different models can now be\nused to fit the time series data and detect structural changes (breaks).\n",
