Additionally, the applicability to real-life HEP\nexperiments plays major role in the development process. Apart from\nalgorithmic code, this project also provides an event data model for the\ndescription of track parameters and measurements. Key features of this\nproject include: tracking geometry description which can be constructed\nfrom TGeo, DD4Hep, or GDML input, simple and efficient event data model,\nperformant and highly flexible algorithms for track propagation and\nfitting, basic seed finding algorithms.",
