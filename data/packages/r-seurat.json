Another strength of this package is that global variables and\nfunctions are automatically identified and exported as needed, making it\nstraightforward to tweak existing code to make use of futures."

VGLMs can be loosely thought of as multivariate\nGLMs. VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs that use smoothing.

Currently only fixed-effects\nmodels are implemented. Many (150+) models and distributions are\nestimated by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized MLE. The\nother classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic RR-VGLMs,\nreduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column interaction models)---these\nclasses perform constrained and unconstrained quadratic ordination\n(CQO/UQO) models in ecology, as well as constrained additive ordination\n(CAO).
