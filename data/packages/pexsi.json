It efficiently evaluates certain selected elements of matrix\nfunctions, e.g., the Fermi-Dirac function of the KS Hamiltonian, which\nyields a density matrix. It can be used as an alternative to\ndiagonalization methods for obtaining the density, energy and forces in\nelectronic structure calculations.\n",
