The functions provide an\ninterface to the FORTRAN functions 'lsoda', 'lsodar', 'lsode', 'lsodes'\nof the 'ODEPACK' collection, to the FORTRAN functions 'dvode', 'zvode'\nand 'daspk' and a C-implementation of solvers of the 'Runge-Kutta'\nfamily with fixed or variable time steps. The package contains routines\ndesigned for solving 'ODEs' resulting from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D partial\ndifferential equations ('PDE') that have been converted to 'ODEs' by\nnumerical differencing.\n",
