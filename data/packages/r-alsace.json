Commonly applied\nconstraints include unimodality, non-negativity, and normalization of\ncomponents. Several data matrices may be decomposed simultaneously by\nassuming that one of the two matrices in the bilinear decomposition is\nshared between datasets.",

The\nalgorithm searches for an optimal polynomial describing the warping. It\nis possible to align one sample to a reference, several samples to the\nsame reference, or several samples to several references. One can choose\nbetween calculating individual warpings, or one global warping for a set\nof samples and one reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented:\nRMS (Root Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both\nwarping of peak profiles and of peak lists are supported. A vignette for\nthe latter is contained in the inst/doc directory of the source package\n- the vignette source can be found on the package github site.",
