Extends the fitdistr() function (of the MASS package) with several\nfunctions to help the fit of a parametric distribution to non-censored\nor censored data. Censored data may contain left censored, right\ncensored and interval censored values, with several lower and upper\nbounds. In addition to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the package\nprovides moment matching (MME), quantile matching (QME) and maximum\ngoodness-of-fit estimation (MGE) methods (available only for non-\ncensored data). Weighted versions of MLE, MME and QME are available. See\ne.g. Casella & Berger (2002). Statistical inference. Pacific Grove.",
