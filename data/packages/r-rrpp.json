    "description": "Linear Model Evaluation with Randomized Residuals in a Permutation\nProcedure Linear model calculations are made for many random versions of\ndata. Using residual randomization in a permutation procedure, sums of\nsquares are calculated over many permutations to generate empirical\nprobability distributions for evaluating model effects. This packaged is\ndescribed by Collyer & Adams (2018) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13029>.\nAdditionally, coefficients, statistics, fitted values, and residuals\ngenerated over many permutations can be used for various procedures\nincluding pairwise tests, prediction, classification, and model\ncomparison. This package should provide most tools one could need for\nthe analysis of high-dimensional data, especially in ecology and\nevolutionary biology, but certainly other fields, as well.\n",
