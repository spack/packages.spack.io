You will need to set the CHLOROTMP environment\nvariable to the full path of the directory you want chlorop to use as a\ntemporary directory.\n",

To\nwrite a program to do this in a language such as C or Pascal is a time-\nconsuming inconvenience that may take many lines of code. The job is\neasy with awk, especially the GNU implementation: gawk. The awk utility\ninterprets a special-purpose programming language that makes it possible\nto handle simple data-reformatting jobs with just a few lines of code."
