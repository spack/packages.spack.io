Non-parametric bootstrap\nand permutation resampling-based multiple testing procedures (including\nempirical Bayes methods) for controlling the family-wise error rate\n(FWER), generalized family-wise error rate (gFWER), tail probability of\nthe proportion of false positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate\n(FDR). Several choices of bootstrap-based null distribution are\nimplemented (centered, centered and scaled, quantile- transformed).\nSingle-step and step-wise methods are available. Tests based on a\nvariety of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics based on\nregression parameters from linear and survival models as well as those\nbased on correlation parameters) are included. When probing hypotheses\nwith t-statistics, users may also select a potentially faster null\ndistribution which is multivariate normal with mean zero and variance\ncovariance matrix derived from the vector influence function. Results\nare reported in terms of adjusted p-values, confidence regions and test\nstatistic cutoffs. The procedures are directly applicable to identifying\ndifferentially expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.",
