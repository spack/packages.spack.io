Regression modeling, testing,\nestimation, validation, graphics, prediction, and typesetting by storing\nenhanced model design attributes in the fit.

'rms' works with almost any regression model,\nbut it was especially written to work with binary or ordinal regression\nmodels, Cox regression, accelerated failure time models, ordinary linear\nmodels, the Buckley-James model, generalized least squares for serially\nor spatially correlated observations, generalized linear models, and\nquantile regression.",
