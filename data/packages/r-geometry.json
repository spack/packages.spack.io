Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations,\nhalfspace intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site\nDelaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It runs in\n2D, 3D, 4D, and higher dimensions. It implements the Quickhull algorithm\nfor computing the convex hull. Qhull does not support constrained\nDelaunay triangulations, or mesh generation of non-convex objects, but\nthe package does include some R functions that allow for this.\n",

The ultimate intention is for the package to be a computerized\nembodiment all magic square knowledge, including direct numerical\nverification of properties of magic squares (such as recent results on\nthe determinant of odd-ordered semimagic squares). Some antimagic\nfunctionality is included. The package also serves as a rebuttal to the\noften-heard comment \"I thought R was just for statistics\"."
