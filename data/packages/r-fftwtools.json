The NVIDIA HPC SDK C, C++, and\nFortran compilers support GPU acceleration of HPC modeling and\nsimulation applications with standard C++ and Fortran, OpenACC\ndirectives, and CUDA. GPU-accelerated math libraries maximize\nperformance on common HPC algorithms, and optimized communications\nlibraries enable standards-based multi-GPU and scalable systems\nprogramming. Performance profiling and debugging tools simplify porting\nand optimization of HPC applications.",

This package provides access to\nthe two-dimensional 'FFT', the multivariate 'FFT', and the one-\ndimensional real to complex 'FFT' using the 'FFTW3' library. The package\nincludes the functions fftw() and mvfftw() which are designed to mimic\nthe functionality of the R functions fft() and mvfft(). The 'FFT'\nfunctions have a parameter that allows them to not return the redundant\ncomplex conjugate when the input is real data.\n",
