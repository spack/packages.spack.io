This package provides access to\nthe two-dimensional 'FFT', the multivariate 'FFT', and the one-\ndimensional real to complex 'FFT' using the 'FFTW3' library. The package\nincludes the functions fftw() and mvfftw() which are designed to mimic\nthe functionality of the R functions fft() and mvfft(). The 'FFT'\nfunctions have a parameter that allows them to not return the redundant\ncomplex conjugate when the input is real data.\n",
