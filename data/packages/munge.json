First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive\naccess to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time\nso they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting,\nexecuting, and monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of\nallocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by\nmanaging a queue of pending work.",
