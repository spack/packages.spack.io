Unlike Gibbs sampling which can get stuck in one truncation\nsub-region depending on initial values, this package allows truncation\nbased on disjoint regions that are created by truncation of absolute\nvalues. The GHK algorithm uses simple Cholesky transformation followed\nby recursive simulation of univariate truncated normals hence there are\nalso no convergence issues. Importance sample is returned along with\nsampling weights, based on which, one can calculate integrals over\ntruncated regions for multivariate normals."

Functions are primarily for multivariate\nanalysis and scale construction using factor analysis, principal\ncomponent analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although\nothers provide basic descriptive statistics. Item Response Theory is\ndone using factor analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric correlations.\nFunctions for analyzing data at multiple levels include within and\nbetween group statistics, including correlations and factor analysis.\nFunctions for simulating and testing particular item and test structures\nare included. Several functions serve as a useful front end for\nstructural equation modeling. Graphical displays of path diagrams,\nfactor analysis and structural equation models are created using basic\ngraphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on\npsychometric theory as well as publications in personality research.

Included among the functions\nin phylogenetic comparative biology are various for ancestral state\nreconstruction, model-fitting, simulation of phylogenies and data, and\nmultivariate analysis. There are a broad range of plotting methods for\nphylogenies and comparative data which include, but are not restricted\nto, methods for mapping trait evolution on trees, for projecting trees\ninto phenotypic space or a geographic map, and for visualizing\ncorrelated speciation between trees. Finally, there are a number of\nfunctions for reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating, and\nmanipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative data not covered by\nother packages. For instance, there are functions for randomly or non-\nrandomly attaching species or clades to a phylogeny, for estimating\nsupertrees or consensus phylogenies from a set, for simulating trees and\nphylogenetic data under a range of models, and for a wide variety of\nother manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic biologists might find\nuseful in their research."
