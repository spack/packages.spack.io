The purpose of this package is\nto discover the genes that are differentially expressed between two\nconditions in RNA-seq experiments. Gene expression is measured in counts\nof transcripts and modeled with the Negative Binomial (NB) distribution\nusing a shrinkage approach for dispersion estimation. The method of\nmoment (MM) estimates for dispersion are shrunk towards an estimated\ntarget, which minimizes the average squared difference between the\nshrinkage estimates and the initial estimates. The exact per-gene\nprobability under the NB model is calculated, and used to test the\nhypothesis that the expected expression of a gene in two conditions\nidentically follow a NB distribution."
