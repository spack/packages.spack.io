The NVIDIA HPC SDK C, C++, and\nFortran compilers support GPU acceleration of HPC modeling and\nsimulation applications with standard C++ and Fortran, OpenACC\ndirectives, and CUDA. GPU-accelerated math libraries maximize\nperformance on common HPC algorithms, and optimized communications\nlibraries enable standards-based multi-GPU and scalable systems\nprogramming. Performance profiling and debugging tools simplify porting\nand optimization of HPC applications.",

Whereas the kernel (Linux)\ngoverns access to hardware, memory, filesystems, and the privileges for\naccessing these resources, the C library is responsible for providing\nthe actual C function interfaces userspace applications see, and for\nconstructing higher-level buffered stdio, memory allocation management,\nthread creation and synchronization operations, and so on using the\nlower-level interfaces the kernel provides, as well as for implementing\npure library routines of the C language like strstr, snprintf, strtol,\nexp, sqrt, etc. Musl is a new general-purpose implementation of the C\nlibrary. It is lightweight, fast, simple, free, and aims to be correct\nin the sense of standards-conformance and safety.",
