Memoization can be used to speed up repetitive\nand computational expensive function calls. The first time a function\nthat implements memoization is called the results are stored in a cache\nmemory. The next time the function is called with the same set of\nparameters, the results are momentarily retrieved from the cache\navoiding repeating the calculations. With this package, any R object can\nbe cached in a key-value storage where the key can be an arbitrary set\nof R objects. The cache memory is persistent (on the file system).\n",

The md5\nalgorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1 and sha-256\nalgorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, and the crc32\nalgorithm is described in\nftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. For md5,\nsha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone\nimplementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code\nfrom the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron\nD. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the implementation by Yann Collet is\nused. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used. Please\nnote that this package is not meant to be deployed for cryptographic\npurposes for which more comprehensive (and widely tested) libraries such\nas OpenSSL should be used."
