    "description": "AutomaDeD (Automata-based Debugging for Dissimilar parallel tasks) is a\ntool for automatic diagnosis of performance and correctness problems in\nMPI applications. It creates control-flow models of each MPI process\nand, when a failure occurs, these models are leveraged to find the\norigin of problems automatically. MPI calls are intercepted (using\nwrappers) to create the models. When an MPI application hangs, AutomaDeD\ncreates a progress-dependence graph that helps finding the process (or\ngroup of processes) that caused the hang.\n",
