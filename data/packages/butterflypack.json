    "description": "ButterflyPACK is a mathematical software for rapidly solving large-scale\ndense linear systems that exhibit off-diagonal rank-deficiency. These\nsystems arise frequently from boundary element methods, or factorization\nphases in finite-difference/finite-element methods. ButterflyPACK relies\non low-rank or butterfly formats under Hierarchical matrix, HODLR or\nother hierarchically nested frameworks to compress, factor and solve the\nlinear system in quasi-linear time. The computationally most intensive\nphase, factorization, is accelerated via randomized linear algebras. The\nbutterfly format, originally inspired by the butterfly data flow in fast\nFourier Transform, is a linear algebra tool well-suited for compressing\nmatrices arising from high-frequency wave equations or highly\noscillatory integral operators.\n",
