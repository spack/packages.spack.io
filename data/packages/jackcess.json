The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge\nbetween different logging implementations. A library that uses the\ncommons-logging API can be used with any logging implementation at\nruntime. Commons-logging comes with support for a number of popular\nlogging implementations, and writing adapters for others is a reasonably\nsimple task."
