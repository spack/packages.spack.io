Additionally it contains basic enhancements to\njava.util.Date and a series of utilities dedicated to help with building\nmethods, such as hashCode, toString and equals.",

The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge\nbetween different logging implementations. A library that uses the\ncommons-logging API can be used with any logging implementation at\nruntime. Commons-logging comes with support for a number of popular\nlogging implementations, and writing adapters for others is a reasonably\nsimple task.",
