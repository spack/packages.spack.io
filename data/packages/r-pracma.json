A\nsystem for writing hierarchical statistical models largely compatible\nwith 'BUGS' and 'JAGS', writing nimbleFunctions to operate models and do\nbasic R-style math, and compiling both models and nimbleFunctions via\ncustom-generated C++. 'NIMBLE' includes default methods for MCMC, Monte\nCarlo Expectation Maximization, and some other tools. The nimbleFunction\nsystem makes it easy to do things like implement new MCMC samplers from\nR, customize the assignment of samplers to different parts of a model\nfrom R, and compile the new samplers automatically via C++ alongside the\nsamplers 'NIMBLE' provides. 'NIMBLE' extends the 'BUGS'/'JAGS' language\nby making it extensible: New distributions and functions can be added,\nincluding as calls to external compiled code. Although most people think\nof MCMC as the main goal of the 'BUGS'/'JAGS' language for writing\nmodels, one can use 'NIMBLE' for writing arbitrary other kinds of model-\ngeneric algorithms as well. A full User Manual is available at\n<https://r-nimble.org>.",

These methods\nhandle smooth, possibly box constrained functions of several or many\nparameters. Note that function 'optimr()' was prepared to simplify the\nincorporation of minimization codes going forward. Also implements some\nutility codes and some extra solvers, including safeguarded Newton\nmethods. Many methods previously separate are now included here. This is\nthe version for CRAN.",
