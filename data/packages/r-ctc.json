Trinity partitions the sequence data into many individual de\nBruijn graphs, each representing the transcriptional complexity at a\ngiven gene or locus, and then processes each graph independently to\nextract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease apart transcripts\nderived from paralogous genes.",
