This package\nprovides an aggregation in order to compare different implementations in\norder to provide an 'faster but good enough' alternative for use with R\nand C++ code.\n",

This package also\nserves as a prime example of how to build a package that uses 'Rcpp' to\nconnect to another third-party library.
