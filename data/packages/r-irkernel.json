The implementation is based on\nthe mapping described in the vignette (Ooms, 2014). In addition to\nconverting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to\nstream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with\nthe package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded\nconsistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications."

For md5,\nsha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone\nimplementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code\nfrom the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron\nD. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the implementation by Yann Collet is\nused. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used. Please\nnote that this package is not meant to be deployed for cryptographic\npurposes for which more comprehensive (and widely tested) libraries such\nas OpenSSL should be used."
