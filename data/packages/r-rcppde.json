An efficient C++\nbased implementation of the 'DEoptim' function which performs global\noptimization by differential evolution. Its creation was motivated by\ntrying to see if the old approximation \"easier, shorter, faster: pick\nany two\" could in fact be extended to achieving all three goals while\nmoving the code from plain old C to modern C++. The initial version did\nin fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to an implicit code\nreview which eliminated a few inefficiencies which have since been\neliminated in 'DEoptim'.\n",

The\nalgorithm searches for an optimal polynomial describing the warping. It\nis possible to align one sample to a reference, several samples to the\nsame reference, or several samples to several references. One can choose\nbetween calculating individual warpings, or one global warping for a set\nof samples and one reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented:\nRMS (Root Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both\nwarping of peak profiles and of peak lists are supported. A vignette for\nthe latter is contained in the inst/doc directory of the source package\n- the vignette source can be found on the package github site."
