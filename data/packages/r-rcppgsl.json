There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test\nsuite. The 'RcppGSL' package provides an easy-to-use interface between\n'GSL' data structures and R using concepts from 'Rcpp' which is itself a\npackage that eases the interfaces between R and C++. This package also\nserves as a prime example of how to build a package that uses 'Rcpp' to\nconnect to another third-party library. The 'autoconf' script, 'inline'\nplugin and example package can all be used as a stanza to write a\nsimilar package against another library.\n",
