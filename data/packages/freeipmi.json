The features of IPMI that most users will\nbe interested in are sensor monitoring, system event monitoring, power\ncontrol, and serial-over-LAN (SOL). The FreeIPMI tools and libraries\nlisted below should provide users with the ability to access and utilize\nthese and many other features. A number of useful features for large HPC\nor cluster environments have also been implemented into FreeIPMI. See\nthe README or FAQ for more info.\n",
