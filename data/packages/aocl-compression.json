    "description": " AOCL-Compression is a software framework of various lossless\ncompression and decompression methods tuned and optimized for AMD Zen\nbased CPUs. This framework offers a single set of unified APIs for all\nthe supported compression and decompression methods which facilitate the\napplications to easily integrate and use them. AOCL-Compression supports\nlz4, zlib/deflate, lzma, zstd, bzip2, snappy, and lz4hc based\ncompression and decompression methods along with their native APIs. The\nlibrary offers openMP based multi-threaded implementation of lz4, zlib,\nzstd and snappy compression methods. It supports the dynamic dispatcher\nfeature that executes the most optimal function variant implemented\nusing Function Multi-versioning thereby offering a single optimized\nlibrary portable across different x86 CPU architectures. AOCL-\nCompression framework is developed in C for UNIX\u00ae and Windows\u00ae based\nsystems. A test suite is provided for the validation and performance\nbenchmarking of the supported compression and decompression methods.\nThis suite also supports the benchmarking of IPP compression methods,\nsuch as, lz4, lz4hc, zlib and bzip2. The library build framework offers\nCTest based testing of the test cases implemented using GTest and the\nlibrary test suite.
