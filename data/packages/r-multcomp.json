All methods are applicable to\n(generalized) linear model objects fitted by lm() and glm() but can also\nbe adapted to other classes through S3 methods. Details can be found in\nZeileis et al.

The second edition includes redesigned graphics and additional\nchapters. The authors emphasize how to construct and interpret graphs,\ndiscuss principles of graphical design, and show how accompanying\ntraditional tabular results are used to confirm the visual impressions\nderived directly from the graphs. Many of the graphical formats are\nnovel and appear here for the first time in print. All chapters have\nexercises. All functions introduced in the book are in the package.
