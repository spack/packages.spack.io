    "description": "ERmod (Energy Representation Module) is a program to calculate the\nsolvation free energy based on the energy representation method. The\nprogram allows users to calculate the solvation free energy to arbitrary\nsolvents, including inhomogeneous systems, and can run in cooperation\nwith state-of-art molecular simulation softwares, such as NAMD, GROMACS\nand/or AMBER.\n",

We believe that FFTW, which\nis free software, should become the FFT library of choice for most\napplications."
