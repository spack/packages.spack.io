Almost all other methods instead\nmerge homologous chromosomes into single incorrect 'consensus'\nsequences. Supernova is the only practical method for creating diploid\nassemblies of large genomes. To install this package, you will need to\ngo to the supernova download page of supernova, register with your email\naddress and download supernova yourself. Spack will search your current\ndirectory for the download file. Alternatively, add this file yo a\nmirror so that Spack can find it.
