    "description": "OmpSs is an effort to integrate features from the StarSs programming\nmodel developed by BSC into a single programming model. In particular,\nour objective is to extend OpenMP with new directives to support\nasynchronous parallelism and heterogeneity (devices like GPUs). However,\nit can also be understood as new directives extending other accelerator\nbased APIs like CUDA or OpenCL. Our OmpSs environment is built on top of\nour Mercurium compiler and Nanos++ runtime system.\n",

The Portable Hardware\nLocality (hwloc) software package provides a portable abstraction\n(across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of the hierarchical topology\nof modern architectures, including NUMA memory nodes, sockets, shared\ncaches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It also gathers various\nsystem attributes such as cache and memory information as well as the\nlocality of I/O devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or\nGPUs. It primarily aims at helping applications with gathering\ninformation about modern computing hardware so as to exploit it\naccordingly and efficiently."
