An object-oriented modeling language\nfor disciplined convex programming (DCP) as described in Fu, Narasimhan,\nand Boyd (2020, <doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i14>). It allows the user to\nformulate convex optimization problems in a natural way following\nmathematical convention and DCP rules. The system analyzes the problem,\nverifies its convexity, converts it into a canonical form, and hands it\noff to an appropriate solver to obtain the solution. Interfaces to\nsolvers on CRAN and elsewhere are provided, both commercial and open\nsource.",

For quadratic\nobjectives, unlike interior point solvers based on the standard\nhomogeneous self-dual embedding (HSDE) model, 'Clarabel' handles\nquadratic objective without requiring any epigraphical reformulation of\nits objective function. It can therefore be significantly faster than\nother HSDE-based solvers for problems with quadratic objective\nfunctions. Infeasible problems are detected using using a homogeneous\nembedding technique.\n",
