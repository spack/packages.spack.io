Carries\nout mapping between assorted color spaces including RGB, HSV, HLS,\nCIEXYZ, CIELUV, HCL (polar CIELUV), CIELAB, and polar CIELAB.\nQualitative, sequential, and diverging color palettes based on HCL\ncolors are provided along with corresponding ggplot2 color scales. Color\npalette choice is aided by an interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a\nshiny graphical user interface) and shiny apps with an HCL color picker\nand a color vision deficiency emulator. Plotting functions for\ndisplaying and assessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations\nof the HCL space, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color\nmanipulation functions include: desaturation, lightening/darkening,\nmixing, and simulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly,\nprotanomaly, tritanomaly).

Together with the seamless connection between the\npowerful computational and visual environment in R, it gives users more\nconvenience and freedom to design figures for better understanding\ncomplex patterns behind multiple dimensional data.
