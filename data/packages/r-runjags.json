User-friendly\ninterface utilities for MCMC models via Just Another Gibbs Sampler\n(JAGS), facilitating the use of parallel (or distributed) processors for\nmultiple chains, automated control of convergence and sample length\ndiagnostics, and evaluation of the performance of a model using drop-k\nvalidation or against simulated data. Template model specifications can\nbe generated using a standard lme4-style formula interface to assist\nusers less familiar with the BUGS syntax. A JAGS extension module\nprovides additional distributions including the Pareto family of\ndistributions, the DuMouchel prior and the half-Cauchy prior.\n",
