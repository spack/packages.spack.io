'gRbase'\nfacilitates array operations, 'gRbase' implements functions for testing\nfor conditional independence. 'gRbase' illustrates how hierarchical log-\nlinear models may be implemented and describes concept of graphical meta\ndata. The facilities of the package are documented in the book by\nHojsgaard, Edwards and Lauritzen (2012, <doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-2299-0>)\nand in the paper by Dethlefsen and Hojsgaard, (2005,\n<doi:10.18637/jss.v014.i17>).
