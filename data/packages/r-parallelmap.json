Flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-based\noptimization ('MBO'), also known as Bayesian optimization.

The machine learning\ntoolbox 'mlr' provide dozens of regression learners to model the\nperformance of the target algorithm with respect to the parameter\nsettings. It provides many different infill criteria to guide the search\nprocess. Additional features include multi-point batch proposal,\nparallel execution as well as visualization and sophisticated logging\nmechanisms, which is especially useful for teaching and understanding of\nalgorithm behavior. 'mlrMBO' is implemented in a modular fashion, such\nthat single components can be easily replaced or adapted by the user for\nspecific use cases.",
