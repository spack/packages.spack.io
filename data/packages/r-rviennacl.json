The NVIDIA HPC SDK C, C++, and\nFortran compilers support GPU acceleration of HPC modeling and\nsimulation applications with standard C++ and Fortran, OpenACC\ndirectives, and CUDA. GPU-accelerated math libraries maximize\nperformance on common HPC algorithms, and optimized communications\nlibraries enable standards-based multi-GPU and scalable systems\nprogramming.

The library is written in C++ and supports 'CUDA',\n'OpenCL', and 'OpenMP' (including switches at runtime). I have placed\nthese libraries in this package as a more efficient distribution system\nfor CRAN. The idea is that you can write a package that depends on the\n'ViennaCL' library and yet you do not need to distribute a copy of this\ncode with your package.\n",
