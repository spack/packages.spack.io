    "description": "A set of restricted permutation designs for freely exchangeable, line\ntransects (time series), and spatial grid designs plus permutation of\nblocks (groups of samples) is provided. 'permute' also allows split-plot\ndesigns, in which the whole-plots or split-plots or both can be freely-\nexchangeable or one of the restricted designs. The 'permute' package is\nmodelled after the permutation schemes of 'Canoco 3.1' (and later) by\nCajo ter Braak.\n",
