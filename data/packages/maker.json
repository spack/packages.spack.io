    "description": "MAKER is a portable and easily configurable genome annotation pipeline.\nIt's purpose is to allow smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic\ngenomeprojects to independently annotate their genomes and to create\ngenome databases. MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to\na genome, produces ab-initio gene predictions and automatically\nsynthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based\nquality values. MAKER is also easily trainable: outputs of preliminary\nruns can be used to automatically retrain its gene prediction algorithm,\nproducing higher quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs\nare minimal and its ouputs can be directly loaded into a GMOD database.\nThey can also be viewed in the Apollo genome browser; this feature of\nMAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view and edit individual\ncontigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. MAKER should prove\nespecially useful for emerging model organism projects with minimal\nbioinformatics expertise and computer resources. Note: MAKER requires\nregistration. Fill out the form at\nhttp://yandell.topaz.genetics.utah.edu/cgi-bin/maker_license.cgi to get\na download link. Spack will search your current directory for the\ndownload file. Alternatively, add this file to a mirror so that Spack\ncan find it. For instructions on how to set up a mirror, see\nhttps://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mirrors.html\n",

Of course, as\nthe objects do most of the hard work for you, all you have to do is\ncombine a number of objects together sensibly to make useful scripts.\nThe intent of the BioPerl development effort is to make reusable tools\nthat aid people in creating their own sites or job-specific\napplications. The BioPerl website at https://bioperl.org/ also attempts\nto maintain links and archives of standalone bio-related Perl tools that\nare not affiliated or related to the core BioPerl effort.
