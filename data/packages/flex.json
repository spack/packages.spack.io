Please do not\ndownload this program if you are expecting a full featured replacement\nfor NC-Verilog, VCS or another commercial Verilog simulator or Verilog\ncompiler for a little project!

Verilator supports the\nsynthesis subset of Verilog, plus initial statements, proper\nblocking/non-blocking assignments, functions, tasks, multi-dimensional\narrays, and signed numbers. It also supports very simple forms of\nSystemVerilog assertions and coverage analysis. Verilator supports the\nmore important Verilog 2005 constructs, and some SystemVerilog features,\nwith additional constructs being added as users request them. Verilator\nhas been used to simulate many very large multi-million gate designs\nwith thousands of modules."
