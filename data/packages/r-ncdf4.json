    "description": "Interface to Unidata netCDF (Version 4 or Earlier) Format Data Files.\nProvides a high-level R interface to data files written using Unidata's\nnetCDF library (version 4 or earlier), which are binary data files that\nare portable across platforms and include metadata information in\naddition to the data sets. Using this package, netCDF files (either\nversion 4 or \"classic\" version 3) can be opened and data sets read in\neasily. It is also easy to create new netCDF dimensions, variables, and\nfiles, in either version 3 or 4 format, and manipulate existing netCDF\nfiles. This package replaces the former ncdf package, which only worked\nwith netcdf version 3 files. For various reasons the names of the\nfunctions have had to be changed from the names in the ncdf package. The\nold ncdf package is still available at the URL given below, if you need\nto have backward compatibility. It should be possible to have both the\nncdf and ncdf4 packages installed simultaneously without a problem.\nHowever, the ncdf package does not provide an interface for netcdf\nversion 4 files.\n",
