    "description": "Stack and Reshape Datasets After Splitting Concatenated Values. Online\ndata collection tools like Google Forms often export multiple-response\nquestions with data concatenated in cells. The concat.split (cSplit)\nfamily of functions splits such data into separate cells. The package\nalso includes functions to stack groups of columns and to reshape wide\ndata, even when the data are \"unbalanced\" something which reshape (from\nbase R) does not handle, and which melt and dcast from reshape2 do not\neasily handle.\n",
