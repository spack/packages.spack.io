    "description": "A Collection of Database, Data Structure, Visualization, andUtility\nFunctions for R. The caroline R library contains dozens of functions\nuseful for: database migration (dbWriteTable2), database style joins &\naggregation (nerge, groupBy & bestBy), data structure conversion (nv,\ntab2df), legend table making (sstable & leghead), plot annotation\n(labsegs & mvlabs), data visualization (violins, pies & raPlot),\ncharacter string manipulation (m & pad), file I/O (write.delim), batch\nscripting and more. The package's greatest contributions lie in the\ndatabase style merge, aggregation and interface functions as well as in\nit's extensive use and propagation of row, column and vector names in\nmost functions.\n",

A\nmethod for modeling genetic data as a combination of discrete layers,\nwithin each of which relatedness may decay continuously with geographic\ndistance.

See the paper for more details on the model and its\nutility."
