    "description": "The Object Oriented MicroMagnetic Framework (OOMMF) is aimed at\ndeveloping portable, extensible public domain programs and tools for\nmicromagnetics. The code forms a completely functional micromagnetics\npackage, with the additional capability to be extended by other\nprogrammers so that people developing new code can build on the OOMMF\nfoundation. OOMMF is written in C++, a widely-available, object-oriented\nlanguage that can produce programs with good performance as well as\nextensibility. For portable user interfaces, we make use of Tcl/Tk so\nthat OOMMF operates across a wide range of Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X\nplatforms. The main contributors to OOMMF are Mike Donahue, and Don\nPorter. Summary taken from OOMMF documentation\nhttps://math.nist.gov/oommf/ OOMMF home page:\n\"https://math.nist.gov/oommf/\" OOMMF as a git repository:\nhttps://github.com/fangohr/oommf Versions ending with \"-vanilla\"\nindicate that the sources are taken directly from\nhttps://math.nist.gov/oommf/dist/ . All other versions are from the\nhttps://github.com/fangohr/oommf (which includes the \"-vanilla\" sources,\nand adds additional OOMMF extensions). See\nhttps://github.com/fangohr/oommf for details.\n",
