R/EBSeq is an R package for identifying genes and isoforms\ndifferentially expressed (DE) across two or more biological conditions\nin an RNA-seq experiment. Details can be found in Leng et al., 2013. It\nprovides the syntax required for identifying DE genes and isoforms in a\ntwo-group RNA-seq experiment as well for identifying DE genes across\nmore than two conditions (the commands for identifying DE isoforms\nacross more than two conditions are the same as those required for gene-\nlevel analysis).\n",
