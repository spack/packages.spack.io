As\ndifferent colour spaces have different uses, efficient conversion\nbetween these representations are important. The 'farver' package\nprovides a set of functions that gives access to very fast colour space\nconversion and comparisons implemented in C++, and offers speed\nimprovements over the 'convertColor' function in the 'grDevices'\npackage.\n",
