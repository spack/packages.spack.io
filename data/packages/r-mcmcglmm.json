Functions for reading, writing,\nplotting, and manipulating phylogenetic trees, analyses of comparative\ndata in a phylogenetic framework, ancestral character analyses, analyses\nof diversification and macroevolution, computing distances from DNA\nsequences, reading and writing nucleotide sequences as well as importing\nfrom BioConductor, and several tools such as Mantel's test, generalized\nskyline plots, graphical exploration of phylogenetic data (alex, trex,\nkronoviz), estimation of absolute evolutionary rates and clock-like\ntrees using mean path lengths and penalized likelihood, dating trees\nwith non-contemporaneous sequences, translating DNA into AA sequences,\nand assessing sequence alignments. Phylogeny estimation can be done with\nthe NJ, BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods, and several methods\nhandling incomplete distance matrices (NJ*, BIONJ*, MVR*, and the\ncorresponding triangle method). Some functions call external\napplications (PhyML, Clustal, T-Coffee, Muscle) whose results are\nreturned into R.",

Implements\na James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator for the covariance matrix, with\nseparate shrinkage for variances and correlations. The details of the\nmethod are explained in Schafer and Strimmer (2005)\n<DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1175> and Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007)\n<DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1252>. The approach is both computationally as\nwell as statistically very efficient, it is applicable to \"small n,\nlarge p\" data, and always returns a positive definite and well-\nconditioned covariance matrix. In addition to inferring the covariance\nmatrix the package also provides shrinkage estimators for partial\ncorrelations and partial variances. The inverse of the covariance and\ncorrelation matrix can be efficiently computed, as well as any arbitrary\npower of the shrinkage correlation matrix. Furthermore, functions are\navailable for fast singular value decomposition, for computing the\npseudoinverse, and for checking the rank and positive definiteness of a\nmatrix.",
