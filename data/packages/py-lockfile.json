    "description": "The lockfile package exports a LockFile class which provides a simple\nAPI for locking files. Unlike the Windows msvcrt.locking function, the\nfcntl.lockf and flock functions, and the deprecated posixfile module,\nthe API is identical across both Unix (including Linux and Mac) and\nWindows platforms. The lock mechanism relies on the atomic nature of the\nlink (on Unix) and mkdir (on Windows) system calls. An implementation\nbased on SQLite is also provided, more as a demonstration of the\npossibilities it provides than as production-quality code.\n",
