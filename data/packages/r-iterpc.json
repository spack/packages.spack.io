    "description": "Efficient Iterator for Permutations and Combinations. Iterator for\ngenerating permutations and combinations. They can be either drawn with\nor without replacement, or with distinct/ non-distinct items (multiset).\nThe generated sequences are in lexicographical order (dictionary order).\nThe algorithms to generate permutations and combinations are memory\nefficient. These iterative algorithms enable users to process all\nsequences without putting all results in the memory at the same time.\nThe algorithms are written in C/C++ for faster performance. Note:\n'iterpc' is no longer being maintained. Users are recommended to switch\nto 'arrangements'.\n",
