QCA separates the API from the\nimplementation, using plugins known as Providers. The advantage of this\nmodel is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly\ndepending on any particular cryptographic library. This allows one to\neasily change or upgrade crypto implementations without even needing to\nrecompile the application! QCA should work everywhere Qt does, including\nWindows/Unix/MacOSX.\n",
