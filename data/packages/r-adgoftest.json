Classes (S4) of commonly used\nelliptical, Archimedean, extreme-value and other copula families, as\nwell as their rotations, mixtures and asymmetrizations.

Methods for\ndensity, distribution, random number generation, bivariate dependence\nmeasures, Rosenblatt transform, Kendall distribution function,\nperspective and contour plots. Fitting of copula models with potentially\npartly fixed parameters, including standard errors. Serial independence\ntests, copula specification tests (independence, exchangeability, radial\nsymmetry, extreme-value dependence, goodness-of-fit) and model selection\nbased on cross-validation. Empirical copula, smoothed versions, and non-\nparametric estimators of the Pickands dependence function.",
