These are useful for\nhandling database keys and exact counting in +-2^63. WARNING: do not use\nthem as replacement for 32bit integers, integer64 are not supported for\nsubscripting by R-core and they have different semantics when combined\nwith double, e.g. integer64 + double => integer64. Class integer64 can\nbe used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames. Methods are\navailable for coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles,\ncharacters and factors as well as many elementwise and summary\nfunctions. Many fast algorithmic operations such as 'match' and 'order'\nsupport inter- active data exploration and manipulation and optionally\nleverage caching.\n",
