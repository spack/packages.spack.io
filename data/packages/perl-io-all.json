MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to\na genome, produces ab-initio gene predictions and automatically\nsynthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based\nquality values. MAKER is also easily trainable: outputs of preliminary\nruns can be used to automatically retrain its gene prediction algorithm,\nproducing higher quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs\nare minimal and its ouputs can be directly loaded into a GMOD database.\nThey can also be viewed in the Apollo genome browser; this feature of\nMAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view and edit individual\ncontigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. MAKER should prove\nespecially useful for emerging model organism projects with minimal\nbioinformatics expertise and computer resources. Note: MAKER requires\nregistration. Fill out the form at\nhttp://yandell.topaz.genetics.utah.edu/cgi-bin/maker_license.cgi to get\na download link. Spack will search your current directory for the\ndownload file. Alternatively, add this file to a mirror so that Spack\ncan find it. For instructions on how to set up a mirror, see\nhttps://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mirrors.html",

    "description": "IO::All combines all of the best Perl IO modules into a single nifty\nobject oriented interface to greatly simplify your everyday Perl IO\nidioms. It exports a single function called io, which returns a new\nIO::All object. And that object can do it all! The IO::All object is a\nproxy for IO::File, IO::Dir, IO::Socket, Tie::File, File::Spec,\nFile::Path, File::MimeInfo and File::ReadBackwards; as well as all the\nDBM and MLDBM modules. You can use most of the methods found in these\nclasses and in IO::Handle (which they inherit from). IO::All adds dozens\nof other helpful idiomatic methods including file stat and manipulation\nfunctions. IO::All is pluggable, and modules like IO::All::LWP and\nIO::All::Mailto add even more functionality. Optionally, every IO::All\nobject can be tied to itself. This means that you can use most perl IO\nbuiltins on it: readline, <>, getc, print, printf, syswrite, sysread,\nclose.\n",
