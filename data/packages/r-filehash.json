Implementation of a function\n'digest()' for the creation of hash digests of arbitrary R objects\n(using the md5, sha-1, sha-256, crc32, xxhash and murmurhash algorithms)\npermitting easy comparison of R language objects, as well as a function\n'hmac()' to create hash-based message authentication code. The md5\nalgorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1 and sha-256\nalgorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, and the crc32\nalgorithm is described in\nftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. For md5,\nsha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone\nimplementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code\nfrom the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron\nD. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the implementation by Yann Collet is\nused. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used. Please\nnote that this package is not meant to be deployed for cryptographic\npurposes for which more comprehensive (and widely tested) libraries such\nas OpenSSL should be used.",

A simple interface is provided for inserting,\nretrieving, and deleting data from the database. Utilities are provided\nthat allow 'filehash' databases to be treated much like environments and\nlists are already used in R. These utilities are provided to encourage\ninteractive and exploratory analysis on large datasets. Three different\nfile formats for representing the database are currently available and\nnew formats can easily be incorporated by third parties for use in the\n'filehash' framework.\n",
