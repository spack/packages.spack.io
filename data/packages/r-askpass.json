Includes native programs for MacOS and Windows, hence no\n'tcltk' is required. Password entry can be invoked in two different\nways: directly from R via the askpass() function, or indirectly as\npassword-entry back-end for 'ssh-agent' or 'git-credential' via the\nSSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS environment variables. Thereby the user can\nbe prompted for credentials or a passphrase if needed when R calls out\nto git or ssh.\n",
