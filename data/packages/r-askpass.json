    "description": "Safe Password Entry for R, Git, and SSH. Cross-platform utilities for\nprompting the user for credentials or a passphrase, for example to\nauthenticate with a server or read a protected key. Includes native\nprograms for MacOS and Windows, hence no 'tcltk' is required. Password\nentry can be invoked in two different ways: directly from R via the\naskpass() function, or indirectly as password-entry back-end for 'ssh-\nagent' or 'git-credential' via the SSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS\nenvironment variables. Thereby the user can be prompted for credentials\nor a passphrase if needed when R calls out to git or ssh.\n",
