The NVIDIA HPC SDK C, C++, and\nFortran compilers support GPU acceleration of HPC modeling and\nsimulation applications with standard C++ and Fortran, OpenACC\ndirectives, and CUDA. GPU-accelerated math libraries maximize\nperformance on common HPC algorithms, and optimized communications\nlibraries enable standards-based multi-GPU and scalable systems\nprogramming.

Compares k samples using the\nAnderson-Darling test, Kruskal-Wallis type tests with different rank\nscore criteria, Steel's multiple comparison test, and the Jonckheere-\nTerpstra (JT) test. It computes asymptotic, simulated or (limited) exact\nP-values, all valid under randomization, with or without ties, or\nconditionally under random sampling from populations, given the observed\ntie pattern. Except for Steel's test and the JT test it also combines\nthese tests across several blocks of samples. Also analyzed are 2 x t\ncontingency tables and their blocked combinations using the Kruskal-\nWallis criterion. Steel's test is inverted to provide simultaneous\nconfidence bounds for shift parameters. A plotting function compares\ntail probabilities obtained under asymptotic approximation with those\nobtained via simulation or exact calculations.",

Van der Waerden's normal scores test for\nomnibus, all-pairs and many-to-one tests is provided for non-normally\ndistributed residuals and homogeneous variances. The Kruskal-Wallis, BWS\nand Anderson-Darling omnibus test and all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test,\nDunn test, Conover test, Dwass-Steele-Critchlow- Fligner test) as well\nas many-to-one (Nemenyi test, Dunn test, U-test) are given for the\nanalysis of variance by ranks. Non-parametric trend tests (Jonckheere\ntest, Cuzick test, Johnson-Mehrotra test, Spearman test) are included.\nIn addition, a Friedman-test for one-way ANOVA with repeated measures on\nranks (CRBD) and Skillings-Mack test for unbalanced CRBD is provided\nwith consequent all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test, Siegel test, Miller test,\nConover test, Exact test) and many-to-one tests (Nemenyi test, Demsar\ntest, Exact test). A trend can be tested with Pages's test. Durbin's\ntest for a two-way balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is given in\nthis package as well as Gore's test for CRBD with multiple observations\nper cell is given. Outlier tests, Mandel's k- and h statistic as well as\nfunctions for Type I error and Power analysis as well as generic\nsummary, print and plot methods are provided.",
