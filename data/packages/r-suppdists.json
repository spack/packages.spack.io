Compares k samples using the\nAnderson-Darling test, Kruskal-Wallis type tests with different rank\nscore criteria, Steel's multiple comparison test, and the Jonckheere-\nTerpstra (JT) test. It computes asymptotic, simulated or (limited) exact\nP-values, all valid under randomization, with or without ties, or\nconditionally under random sampling from populations, given the observed\ntie pattern. Except for Steel's test and the JT test it also combines\nthese tests across several blocks of samples. Also analyzed are 2 x t\ncontingency tables and their blocked combinations using the Kruskal-\nWallis criterion. Steel's test is inverted to provide simultaneous\nconfidence bounds for shift parameters. A plotting function compares\ntail probabilities obtained under asymptotic approximation with those\nobtained via simulation or exact calculations.",

            "description": "Calculate Pairwise Multiple Comparisons of Mean Rank Sums Extended. For\none-way layout experiments the one-way ANOVA can be performed as an\nomnibus test. All-pairs multiple comparisons tests (Tukey-Kramer test,\nScheffe test, LSD-test) and many-to-one tests (Dunnett test) for\nnormally distributed residuals and equal within variance are available.\nFurthermore, all-pairs tests (Games-Howell test, Tamhane's T2 test,\nDunnett T3 test, Ury-Wiggins-Hochberg test) and many-to-one (Tamhane-\nDunnett Test) for normally distributed residuals and heterogeneous\nvariances are provided. Van der Waerden's normal scores test for\nomnibus, all-pairs and many-to-one tests is provided for non-normally\ndistributed residuals and homogeneous variances. The Kruskal-Wallis, BWS\nand Anderson-Darling omnibus test and all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test,\nDunn test, Conover test, Dwass-Steele-Critchlow- Fligner test) as well\nas many-to-one (Nemenyi test, Dunn test, U-test) are given for the\nanalysis of variance by ranks. Non-parametric trend tests (Jonckheere\ntest, Cuzick test, Johnson-Mehrotra test, Spearman test) are included.\nIn addition, a Friedman-test for one-way ANOVA with repeated measures on\nranks (CRBD) and Skillings-Mack test for unbalanced CRBD is provided\nwith consequent all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test, Siegel test, Miller test,\nConover test, Exact test) and many-to-one tests (Nemenyi test, Demsar\ntest, Exact test). A trend can be tested with Pages's test. Durbin's\ntest for a two-way balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is given in\nthis package as well as Gore's test for CRBD with multiple observations\nper cell is given. Outlier tests, Mandel's k- and h statistic as well as\nfunctions for Type I error and Power analysis as well as generic\nsummary, print and plot methods are provided.",
