A normalization and copy number variation calling\nprocedure for whole exome DNA sequencing data. CODEX relies on the\navailability of multiple samples processed using the same sequencing\npipeline for normalization, and does not require matched controls. The\nnormalization model in CODEX includes terms that specifically remove\nbiases due to GC content, exon length and targeting and amplification\nefficiency, and latent systemic artifacts. CODEX also includes a Poisson\nlikelihood-based recursive segmentation procedure that explicitly models\nthe count-based exome sequencing data.\n",
