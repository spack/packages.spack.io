    "description": "The DSDP software is a free open source implementation of an interior-\npoint method for semidefinite programming. It provides primal and dual\nsolutions, exploits low-rank structure and sparsity in the data, and has\nrelatively low memory requirements for an interior-point method. It\nallows feasible and infeasible starting points and provides approximate\ncertificates of infeasibility when no feasible solution exists.\n",
