The\n'Blaze' library offers: - high performance through the integration of\n'BLAS' libraries and manually tuned 'HPC' math kernels - vectorization\nby 'SSE', 'SSE2', 'SSE3', 'SSSE3', 'SSE4', 'AVX', 'AVX2', 'AVX-512',\n'FMA', and 'SVML' - parallel execution by 'OpenMP', C++11 threads and\n'Boost' threads ('Boost' threads are disabled in 'RcppBlaze') - the\nintuitive and easy to use API of a domain specific language - unified\narithmetic with dense and sparse vectors and matrices - thoroughly\ntested matrix and vector arithmetic - completely portable, high quality\nC++ source code. The 'RcppBlaze' package includes the header files from\nthe 'Blaze' library with disabling some functionalities related to link\nto the thread and system libraries which make 'RcppBlaze' be a header-\nonly library. Therefore, users do not need to install 'Blaze' and the\ndependency 'Boost'. 'Blaze' is licensed under the New (Revised) BSD\nlicense, while 'RcppBlaze' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to 'Blaze') is\nlicensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'.\nNote that since 'Blaze' has committed to 'C++14' commit to 'C++14' which\ndoes not used by most R users from version 3.0, we will use the version\n2.6 of 'Blaze' which is 'C++98' compatible to support the most compilers\nand system."

In addition, all parameters of the response\ndistribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional\nregression.
