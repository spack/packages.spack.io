Several features are still under active\ndevelopment, including cloud storage of cached objects, allowing for\nsharing between users. Several advanced options are available, see\n?reproducibleOptions.",

    "description": "Wrappers for 'GDAL' Utilities Executables. R's 'sf' package ships with\nself-contained 'GDAL' executables, including a bare bones interface to\nseveral 'GDAL'-related utility programs collectively known as the 'GDAL\nutilities'. For each of those utilities, this package provides an R\nwrapper whose formal arguments closely mirror those of the 'GDAL'\ncommand line interface. The utilities operate on data stored in files\nand typically write their output to other files. Therefore, to process\ndata stored in any of R's more common spatial formats (i.e. those\nsupported by the 'sp', 'sf', and 'raster' packages), first write them to\ndisk, then process them with the package's wrapper functions before\nreading the outputted results back into R. GDAL function arguments\nintroduced in GDAL version 3.2.1 or earlier are supported.\n",
