    "description": "Variance stabilization and calibration for microarray data. The package\nimplements a method for normalising microarray intensities, and works\nfor single- and multiple-color arrays. It can also be used for data from\nother technologies, as long as they have similar format. The method uses\na robust variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator for an additive-\nmultiplicative error model and affine calibration. The model\nincorporates data calibration step (a.k.a. normalization), a model for\nthe dependence of the variance on the mean intensity and a variance\nstabilizing data transformation. Differences between transformed\nintensities are analogous to \"normalized log-ratios\". However, in\ncontrast to the latter, their variance is independent of the mean, and\nthey are usually more sensitive and specific in detecting differential\ntranscription.\n",
