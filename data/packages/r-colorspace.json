Color\npalette choice is aided by an interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a\nshiny graphical user interface) and shiny apps with an HCL color picker\nand a color vision deficiency emulator. Plotting functions for\ndisplaying and assessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations\nof the HCL space, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color\nmanipulation functions include: desaturation, lightening/darkening,\nmixing, and simulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly,\nprotanomaly, tritanomaly).
