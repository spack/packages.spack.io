    "description": "An interface package for the BIOM file format. This is an R package for\ninterfacing with the BIOM format. This package includes basic tools for\nreading biom-format files, accessing and subsetting data tables from a\nbiom object (which is more complex than a single table), as well as\nlimited support for writing a biom-object back to a biom-format file.\nThe design of this API is intended to match the python API and other\ntools included with the biom-format project, but with a decidedly \"R\nflavor\" that should be familiar to R users. This includes S4 classes and\nmethods, as well as extensions of common core functions/methods.\n",

For example, you might want to fit a model to each\nspatial location or time point in your study, summarise data by panels\nor collapse high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary statistics. The\ndevelopment of 'plyr' has been generously supported by 'Becton\nDickinson'."

Started out as\na fork of 'RJSONIO', but has been completely rewritten in recent\nversions. The package offers flexible, robust, high performance tools\nfor working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful for building\npipelines and interacting with a web API. The implementation is based on\nthe mapping described in the vignette (Ooms, 2014). In addition to\nconverting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to\nstream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with\nthe package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded\nconsistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications."

The rhdf5 package is\nthus suited for the exchange of large and/or complex datasets between R\nand other software package, and for letting R applications work on\ndatasets that are larger than the available RAM."
