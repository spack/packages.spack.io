Trinity partitions the sequence data into many individual de\nBruijn graphs, each representing the transcriptional complexity at a\ngiven gene or locus, and then processes each graph independently to\nextract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease apart transcripts\nderived from paralogous genes.",

    "description": "Fast Hierarchical Clustering Routines for R and 'Python'. This is a two-\nin-one package which provides interfaces to both R and 'Python'. It\nimplements fast hierarchical, agglomerative clustering routines. Part of\nthe functionality is designed as drop-in replacement for existing\nroutines: linkage() in the 'SciPy' package 'scipy.cluster.hierarchy',\nhclust() in R's 'stats' package, and the 'flashClust' package. It\nprovides the same functionality with the benefit of a much faster\nimplementation. Moreover, there are memory-saving routines for\nclustering of vector data, which go beyond what the existing packages\nprovide. For information on how to install the 'Python' files, see the\nfile INSTALL in the source distribution.\n",
