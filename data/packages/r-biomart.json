    "description": "Interface to BioMart databases (i.e. Ensembl) In recent years a wealth\nof biological data has become available in public data repositories.\nEasy access to these valuable data resources and firm integration with\ndata analysis is needed for comprehensive bioinformatics data analysis.\nbiomaRt provides an interface to a growing collection of databases\nimplementing the BioMart software suite (<http://www.biomart.org>). The\npackage enables retrieval of large amounts of data in a uniform way\nwithout the need to know the underlying database schemas or write\ncomplex SQL queries. The most prominent examples of BioMart databases\nare maintain by Ensembl, which provides biomaRt users direct access to a\ndiverse set of data and enables a wide range of powerful online queries\nfrom gene annotation to database mining.\n",
