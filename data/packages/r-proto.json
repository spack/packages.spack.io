The package also has facilities\nfor translating formulas to functions and allowing such formulas in\nfunction calls instead of functions. This can be used with R functions\nsuch as apply, sapply, lapply, optim, integrate, xyplot, Filter and any\nother function that expects another function as an input argument or\nfunctions like cat or sql calls that may involve strings where\nsubstitution is desirable.",

The sqldf() or read.csv.sql() functions can also be used to read\nfiltered files into R even if the original files are larger than R\nitself can handle.
