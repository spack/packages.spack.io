One can choose\nbetween calculating individual warpings, or one global warping for a set\nof samples and one reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented:\nRMS (Root Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both\nwarping of peak profiles and of peak lists are supported.

On Linux and 'macOS', if a suitable system build of\nNLopt (2.7.0 or later) is found, it is used; otherwise, it is built from\nincluded sources via 'CMake'. On Windows, NLopt is obtained through\n'rwinlib' for 'R <= 4.1.x' or grabbed from the 'Rtools42 toolchain' for\n'R >= 4.2.0'.\n",
