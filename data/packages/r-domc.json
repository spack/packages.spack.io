Foreach is an idiom that allows for iterating over elements\nin a collection, without the use of an explicit loop counter.

In that sense, it is similar to the\nstandard lapply function, but doesn't require the evaluation of a\nfunction. Using foreach without side effects also facilitates executing\nthe loop in parallel.",
