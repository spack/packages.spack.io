Additional functions are available\nfor reshaping, reordering, manipulating and visualizing correlation\nmatrix. Functions are also included to facilitate the analysis of\nfactorial experiments, including purely 'within-Ss' designs (repeated\nmeasures), purely 'between-Ss' designs, and mixed 'within-and-between-\nSs' designs. It's also possible to compute several effect size metrics,\nincluding \"eta squared\" for ANOVA, \"Cohen's d\" for t-test and 'Cramer V'\nfor the association between categorical variables. The package contains\nhelper functions for identifying univariate and multivariate outliers,\nassessing normality and homogeneity of variances."

Each variable has its own imputation model.\nBuilt-in imputation models are provided for continuous data (predictive\nmean matching, normal), binary data (logistic regression), unordered\ncategorical data (polytomous logistic regression) and ordered\ncategorical data (proportional odds). MICE can also impute continuous\ntwo-level data (normal model, pan, second-level variables). Passive\nimputation can be used to maintain consistency between variables.\nVarious diagnostic plots are available to inspect the quality of the\nimputations."
