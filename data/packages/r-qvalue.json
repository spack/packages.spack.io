This package takes\na list of p-values resulting from the simultaneous testing of many\nhypotheses and estimates their q-values and local FDR values. The\nq-value of a test measures the proportion of false positives incurred\n(called the false discovery rate) when that particular test is called\nsignificant. The local FDR measures the posterior probability the null\nhypothesis is true given the test's p-value. Various plots are\nautomatically generated, allowing one to make sensible significance cut-\noffs. Several mathematical results have recently been shown on the\nconservative accuracy of the estimated q-values from this software. The\nsoftware can be applied to problems in genomics, brain imaging,\nastrophysics, and data mining.\n",
