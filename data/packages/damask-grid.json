In these materials,\ndeformation happens interrelated with displacive phase transformation,\nsignificant heating, and potential damage evolution. Therefore, DAMASK\nis capable of handling multi-physics problems. Following a modular\napproach, additional field equations are solved in a fully coupled way\nusing a staggered approach.",
