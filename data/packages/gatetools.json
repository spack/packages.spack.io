It currently supports simulations of Emission\nTomography (Positron Emission Tomography - PET and Single Photon\nEmission Computed Tomography - SPECT), Computed Tomography (CT), Optical\nImaging (Bioluminescence and Fluorescence) and Radiotherapy experiments.\nUsing an easy-to-learn macro mechanism to configurate simple or highly\nsophisticated experimental settings, GATE now plays a key role in the\ndesign of new medical imaging devices, in the optimization of\nacquisition protocols and in the development and assessment of image\nreconstruction algorithms and correction techniques. It can also be used\nfor dose calculation in radiotherapy experiments.",
