The flexibility of the package is\nbased on the usage of low-level graphics functions such that self-\ndefined high-level graphics can be easily implemented by users for\nspecific purposes. Together with the seamless connection between the\npowerful computational and visual environment in R, it gives users more\nconvenience and freedom to design figures for better understanding\ncomplex patterns behind multiple dimensional data. The package is\ndescribed in Gu et al. 2014 <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu393>.",

The GenomicRanges package defines\ngeneral purpose containers for storing and manipulating genomic\nintervals and variables defined along a genome. More specialized\ncontainers for representing and manipulating short alignments against a\nreference genome, or a matrix-like summarization of an experiment, are\ndefined in the GenomicAlignments and SummarizedExperiment packages,\nrespectively. Both packages build on top of the GenomicRanges\ninfrastructure.",
