    "description": "The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions\nespecially targeted at applications in the field of analysis and\nverification of complex systems. These abstractions include convex\npolyhedra, some special classes of polyhedra shapes that offer\ninteresting complexity/precision tradeoffs, and grids which represent\nregularly spaced points that satisfy a set of linear congruence\nrelations. The library also supports finite powersets and products of\npolyhedra and grids, a mixed integer linear programming problem solver\nusing an exact-arithmetic version of the simplex algorithm, a parametric\ninteger programming solver, and primitives for termination analysis via\nthe automatic synthesis of linear ranking functions.\n",
