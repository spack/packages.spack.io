These abstractions include convex\npolyhedra, some special classes of polyhedra shapes that offer\ninteresting complexity/precision tradeoffs, and grids which represent\nregularly spaced points that satisfy a set of linear congruence\nrelations. The library also supports finite powersets and products of\npolyhedra and grids, a mixed integer linear programming problem solver\nusing an exact-arithmetic version of the simplex algorithm, a parametric\ninteger programming solver, and primitives for termination analysis via\nthe automatic synthesis of linear ranking functions.\n",
