The fit.models function and its associated\nmethods (coefficients, print, summary, plot, etc.) were originally\nprovided in the robust package to compare robustly and classically\nfitted model objects.

The aim of the\nfit.models package is to separate this fitted model object comparison\nfunctionality from the robust package and to extend it to support\nfitting methods (e.g., classical, robust, Bayesian, regularized, etc.)\nmore generally.\n",
