The functionality\nand data is similar to that of the TxDb packages from the\nGenomicFeatures package, but, in addition to retrieve all\ngene/transcript models and annotations from the database, ensembldb\nprovides a filter framework allowing to retrieve annotations for\nspecific entries like genes encoded on a chromosome region or transcript\nmodels of lincRNA genes. EnsDb databases built with ensembldb contain\nalso protein annotations and mappings between proteins and their\nencoding transcripts. Finally, ensembldb provides functions to map\nbetween genomic, transcript and protein coordinates.\n",
