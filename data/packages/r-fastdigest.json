Includes\nconditional scheduling, restart after interruption, packaging of\nreusable modules, tools for developing arbitrary automated workflows,\nautomated interweaving of modules of different temporal resolution, and\ntools for visualizing and understanding the DES project.",

Provides an R interface\nto Bob Jenkin's streaming, non-cryptographic 'SpookyHash' hash algorithm\nfor use in digest-based comparisons of R objects. 'fastdigest' plugs\ndirectly into R's internal serialization machinery, allowing digests of\nall R objects the serialize() function supports, including reference-\nstyle objects via custom hooks. Speed is high and scales linearly by\nobject size; memory usage is constant and negligible.\n",
