Since each SIMD architecture can be very different and no\ncompiler has yet come along to handle vectorization properly or highly\nefficiently, VOLK approaches the problem differently. For each\narchitecture or platform that a developer wishes to vectorize for, a new\nproto-kernel is added to VOLK. At runtime, VOLK will select the correct\nproto-kernel. In this way, the users of VOLK call a kernel for\nperforming the operation that is platform/architecture agnostic. This\nallows us to write portable SIMD code."
