Cross-platform execution in both fixed and floating point are\nsupported. It includes a framework for easy handling of training data\nsets. It is easy to use, versatile, well documented, and fast. Bindings\nto more than 20 programming languages are available. An easy to read\nintroduction article and a reference manual accompanies the library with\nexamples and recommendations on how to use the library. Several\ngraphical user interfaces are also available for the library.\n",
