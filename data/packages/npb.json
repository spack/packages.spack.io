The\nbenchmarks are derived from computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\napplications and consist of five kernels and three pseudo-applications\nin the original \"pencil-and-paper\" specification (NPB 1). The benchmark\nsuite has been extended to include new benchmarks for unstructured\nadaptive mesh, parallel I/O, multi-zone applications, and computational\ngrids. Problem sizes in NPB are predefined and indicated as different\nclasses. Reference implementations of NPB are available in commonly-used\nprogramming models like MPI and OpenMP (NPB 2 and NPB 3).\n",
