It is typically used to compute a few\neigenvalues/vectors of an n by n matrix, e.g., the k largest\neigenvalues, which is usually more efficient than eigen() if k << n.\nThis package provides the 'eigs()' function that does the similar job as\nin 'Matlab', 'Octave', 'Python SciPy' and 'Julia'. It also provides the\n'svds()' function to calculate the largest k singular values and\ncorresponding singular vectors of a real matrix. The matrix to be\ncomputed on can be dense, sparse, or in the form of an operator defined\nby the user.\n",
