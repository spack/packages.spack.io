Specifically, the sva package contains functions for the\nidentifying and building surrogate variables for high-dimensional data\nsets. Surrogate variables are covariates constructed directly from high-\ndimensional data (like gene expression/RNA sequencing/methylation/brain\nimaging data) that can be used in subsequent analyses to adjust for\nunknown, unmodeled, or latent sources of noise. The sva package can be\nused to remove artifacts in three ways: (1) identifying and estimating\nsurrogate variables for unknown sources of variation in high-throughput\nexperiments (Leek and Storey 2007 PLoS Genetics,2008 PNAS), (2) directly\nremoving known batch effects using ComBat (Johnson et al. 2007\nBiostatistics) and (3) removing batch effects with known control probes\n(Leek 2014 biorXiv). Removing batch effects and using surrogate\nvariables in differential expression analysis have been shown to reduce\ndependence, stabilize error rate estimates, and improve reproducibility,\nsee (Leek and Storey 2007 PLoS Genetics, 2008 PNAS or Leek et al. 2011\nNat.
