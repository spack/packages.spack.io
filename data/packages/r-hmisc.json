The first, Alternative Conditional Expectations (ACE), is an\nalgorithm to find the fixed point of maximal correlation, i.e. it finds\na set of transformed response variables that maximizes R^2 using\nsmoothing functions [see Breiman, L., and J.H. Friedman. 1985.\n\"Estimating Optimal Transformations for Multiple Regression and\nCorrelation\". Journal of the American Statistical Association.\n80:580-598. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1985.10478157>]. Also included is the\nAdditivity Variance Stabilization (AVAS) method which works better than\nACE when correlation is low [see Tibshirani, R.. 1986. \"Estimating\nTransformations for Regression via Additivity and Variance\nStabilization\". Journal of the American Statistical Association.\n83:394-405. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1988.10478610>]. A good introduction\nto these two methods is in chapter 16 of Frank Harrel's \"Regression\nModeling Strategies\" in the Springer Series in Statistics.",
