This\npackage provides a high-level R interface to CoreArray Genomic Data\nStructure (GDS) data files, which are portable across platforms with\nhierarchical structure to store multiple scalable array-oriented data\nsets with metadata information. It is suited for large-scale datasets,\nespecially for data which are much larger than the available random-\naccess memory. The gdsfmt package offers the efficient operations\nspecifically designed for integers of less than 8 bits, since a diploid\ngenotype, like single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), usually occupies\nfewer bits than a byte. Data compression and decompression are available\nwith relatively efficient random access. It is also allowed to read a\nGDS file in parallel with multiple R processes supported by the package\nparallel.",

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely\nused to investigate the genetic basis of diseases and traits, but they\npose many computational challenges. We developed an R package SNPRelate\nto provide a binary format for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data\nin GWAS utilizing CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data files. The\nGDS format offers the efficient operations specifically designed for\nintegers with two bits, since a SNP could occupy only two bits.\nSNPRelate is also designed to accelerate two key computations on SNP\ndata using parallel computing for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing\ncomputer architectures: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and\nrelatedness analysis using Identity-By-Descent measures. The SNP GDS\nformat is also used by the GWASTools package with the support of S4\nclasses and generic functions. The extended GDS format is implemented in\nthe SeqArray package to support the storage of single nucleotide\nvariations (SNVs), insertion/deletion polymorphism (indel) and\nstructural variation calls.",
