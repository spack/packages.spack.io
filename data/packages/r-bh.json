    "description": "Boost C++ Header Files. Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++\nsource libraries. A large part of Boost is provided as C++ template code\nwhich is resolved entirely at compile-time without linking. This package\naims to provide the most useful subset of Boost libraries for template\nuse among CRAN package. By placing these libraries in this package, we\noffer a more efficient distribution system for CRAN as replication of\nthis code in the sources of other packages is avoided. As of release\n1.60.0-2, the following Boost libraries are included: 'algorithm' 'any'\n'bimap' 'bind' 'circular_buffer' 'concept' 'config' 'container'\n'date'_'time' 'detail' 'dynamic_bitset' 'exception' 'filesystem'\n'flyweight' 'foreach' 'functional' 'fusion' 'geometry' 'graph' 'heap'\n'icl' 'integer' 'interprocess' 'intrusive' 'io' 'iostreams' 'iterator'\n'math' 'move' 'mpl' 'multiprcecision' 'numeric' 'pending' 'phoenix'\n'preprocessor' 'random' 'range' 'smart_ptr' 'spirit' 'tuple'\n'type_trains' 'typeof' 'unordered' 'utility' 'uuid'.\n",

The\n'Blaze' library offers: - high performance through the integration of\n'BLAS' libraries and manually tuned 'HPC' math kernels - vectorization\nby 'SSE', 'SSE2', 'SSE3', 'SSSE3', 'SSE4', 'AVX', 'AVX2', 'AVX-512',\n'FMA', and 'SVML' - parallel execution by 'OpenMP', C++11 threads and\n'Boost' threads ('Boost' threads are disabled in 'RcppBlaze') - the\nintuitive and easy to use API of a domain specific language - unified\narithmetic with dense and sparse vectors and matrices - thoroughly\ntested matrix and vector arithmetic - completely portable, high quality\nC++ source code. The 'RcppBlaze' package includes the header files from\nthe 'Blaze' library with disabling some functionalities related to link\nto the thread and system libraries which make 'RcppBlaze' be a header-\nonly library. Therefore, users do not need to install 'Blaze' and the\ndependency 'Boost'.
