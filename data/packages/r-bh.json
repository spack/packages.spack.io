The\n'Blaze' library offers: - high performance through the integration of\n'BLAS' libraries and manually tuned 'HPC' math kernels - vectorization\nby 'SSE', 'SSE2', 'SSE3', 'SSSE3', 'SSE4', 'AVX', 'AVX2', 'AVX-512',\n'FMA', and 'SVML' - parallel execution by 'OpenMP', C++11 threads and\n'Boost' threads ('Boost' threads are disabled in 'RcppBlaze') - the\nintuitive and easy to use API of a domain specific language - unified\narithmetic with dense and sparse vectors and matrices - thoroughly\ntested matrix and vector arithmetic - completely portable, high quality\nC++ source code. The 'RcppBlaze' package includes the header files from\nthe 'Blaze' library with disabling some functionalities related to link\nto the thread and system libraries which make 'RcppBlaze' be a header-\nonly library.
