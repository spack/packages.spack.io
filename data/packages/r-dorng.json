Foreach is an idiom that allows for iterating over elements\nin a collection, without the use of an explicit loop counter. This\npackage in particular is intended to be used for its return value,\nrather than for its side effects. In that sense, it is similar to the\nstandard lapply function, but doesn't require the evaluation of a\nfunction. Using foreach without side effects also facilitates executing\nthe loop in parallel.",
