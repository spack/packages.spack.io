    "description": "XML::Writer is a helper module for Perl programs that write an XML\ndocument. The module handles all escaping for attribute values and\ncharacter data and constructs different types of markup, such as tags,\ncomments, and processing instructions. By default, the module performs\nseveral well-formedness checks to catch errors during output. This\nbehaviour can be extremely useful during development and debugging, but\nit can be turned off for production-grade code. The module can operate\neither in regular mode in or Namespace processing mode. In Namespace\nmode, the module will generate Namespace Declarations itself, and will\nperform additional checks on the output.\n",
