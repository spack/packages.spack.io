Based on the HDF5 standard, it\nalso provides a base from which other formats can be derived and is a\ngood choice for long term data archiving. An independent software\nlibrary (libkea) provides complete access to the KEA image format and a\nGDAL driver allowing KEA images to be used from any GDAL supported\nsoftware. Development work on this project has been funded by Landcare\nResearch.\n",
