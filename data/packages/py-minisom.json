SOM is a type of Artificial Neural Network able\nto convert complex, nonlinear statistical relationships between high-\ndimensional data items into simple geometric relationships on a low-\ndimensional display. Minisom is designed to allow researchers to easily\nbuild on top of it and to give students the ability to quickly grasp its\ndetails. The project initially aimed for a minimalistic implementation\nof the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm, focusing on simplicity in\nfeatures, dependencies, and code style. Although it has expanded in\nterms of features, it remains minimalistic by relying only on the numpy\nlibrary and emphasizing vectorization in coding style.\n",
