The main motivation\nfor creating this is to address some crucial incorrectness issues (see\nitem 3 in the list below) that exist in all other resizing packages I am\naware of. As far as I know, it is the only one that performs correctly\nin all cases. ResizeRight is specially made for machine learning, image\nenhancement and restoration challenges.\n",
