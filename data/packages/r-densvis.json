    "description": "Density-Preserving Data Visualization via Non-Linear Dimensionality\nReduction. Implements the density-preserving modification to t-SNE and\nUMAP described by Narayan et al. (2020) . The non-linear dimensionality\nreduction techniques t-SNE and UMAP enable users to summarise complex\nhigh-dimensional sequencing data such as single cell RNAseq using lower\ndimensional representations. These lower dimensional representations\nenable the visualisation of discrete transcriptional states, as well as\ncontinuous trajectory (for example, in early development). However,\nthese methods focus on the local neighbourhood structure of the data. In\nsome cases, this results in misleading visualisations, where the density\nof cells in the low-dimensional embedding does not represent the\ntranscriptional heterogeneity of data in the original high-dimensional\nspace. den-SNE and densMAP aim to enable more accurate visual\ninterpretation of high-dimensional datasets by producing lower-\ndimensional embeddings that accurately represent the heterogeneity of\nthe original high-dimensional space, enabling the identification of\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous cell states. This accuracy is accomplished\nby including in the optimisation process a term which considers the\nlocal density of points in the original high-dimensional space. This can\nhelp to create visualisations that are more representative of\nheterogeneity in the original high-dimensional space.\n",
