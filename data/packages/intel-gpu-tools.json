    "description": "Intel GPU Tools is a collection of tools for development and testing of\nthe Intel DRM driver. There are many macro-level test suites that get\nused against the driver, including xtest, rendercheck, piglit, and\noglconform, but failures from those can be difficult to track down to\nkernel changes, and many require complicated build procedures or\nspecific testing environments to get useful results. Therefore, Intel\nGPU Tools includes low-level tools and tests specifically for\ndevelopment and testing of the Intel DRM Driver.\n",
