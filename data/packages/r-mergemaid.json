The main function is 'mergeExprs' which transforms the\ninput objects into data in the merged format, such that common genes in\ndifferent datasets can be easily found. And the function 'intcor'\ncalculate the correlation coefficients. Other functions use the output\nfrom 'modelOutcome' to graphically display the results and cross-\nvalidate associations of gene expression data with survival.\n",
