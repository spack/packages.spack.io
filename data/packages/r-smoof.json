Originally, that was too slow for converting large R objects to\nJSON and was not extensible. rjson's performance is now similar to this\npackage, and perhaps slightly faster in some cases. This package uses\nmethods and is readily extensible by defining methods for different\nclasses, vectorized operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions\nfor deserializing JSON objects to R. The two packages intentionally\nshare the same basic interface. This package (RJSONIO) has many\nadditional options to allow customizing the generation and processing of\nJSON content. This package uses libjson rather than implementing yet\nanother JSON parser. The aim is to support other general projects by\nbuilding on their work, providing feedback and benefit from their\nongoing development."
