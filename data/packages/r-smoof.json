This package uses\nmethods and is readily extensible by defining methods for different\nclasses, vectorized operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions\nfor deserializing JSON objects to R. The two packages intentionally\nshare the same basic interface. This package (RJSONIO) has many\nadditional options to allow customizing the generation and processing of\nJSON content.
