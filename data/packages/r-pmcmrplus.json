Except for Steel's test and the JT test it also combines\nthese tests across several blocks of samples. Also analyzed are 2 x t\ncontingency tables and their blocked combinations using the Kruskal-\nWallis criterion. Steel's test is inverted to provide simultaneous\nconfidence bounds for shift parameters.
