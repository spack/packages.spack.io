Implementation of cumulative link\n(mixed) models also known as ordered regression models, proportional\nodds models, proportional hazards models for grouped survival times and\nordered logit/probit/... models. Estimation is via maximum likelihood\nand mixed models are fitted with the Laplace approximation and adaptive\nGauss-Hermite quadrature. Multiple random effect terms are allowed and\nthey may be nested, crossed or partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of\nsymmetry and equidistance can be imposed on the thresholds (cut-\npoints/intercepts). Standard model methods are available (summary,\nanova, drop-methods, step, confint, predict etc.) in addition to profile\nmethods and slice methods for visualizing the likelihood function and\nchecking convergence.",
