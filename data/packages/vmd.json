    "description": "VMD provides user-editable materials which can be applied to molecular\ngeometry. These material properties control the details of how VMD\nshades the molecular geometry, and how transparent or opaque the\ndisplayed molecular geometry is. With this feature, one can easily\ncreate nice looking transparent surfaces which allow inner structural\ndetails to be seen within a large molecular structure. The material\ncontrols can be particularly helpful when rendering molecular scenes\nusing external ray tracers, each of which typically differ slightly.\n",
