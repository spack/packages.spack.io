Functionality is\nconcentrated in phylogenetic comparative biology, but also includes\nnumerous methods for visualizing, manipulating, reading or writing, and\neven inferring phylogenetic trees and data. Included among the functions\nin phylogenetic comparative biology are various for ancestral state\nreconstruction, model-fitting, simulation of phylogenies and data, and\nmultivariate analysis. There are a broad range of plotting methods for\nphylogenies and comparative data which include, but are not restricted\nto, methods for mapping trait evolution on trees, for projecting trees\ninto phenotypic space or a geographic map, and for visualizing\ncorrelated speciation between trees. Finally, there are a number of\nfunctions for reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating, and\nmanipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative data not covered by\nother packages. For instance, there are functions for randomly or non-\nrandomly attaching species or clades to a phylogeny, for estimating\nsupertrees or consensus phylogenies from a set, for simulating trees and\nphylogenetic data under a range of models, and for a wide variety of\nother manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic biologists might find\nuseful in their research."

The major methods; include cubic, and thin plate splines,\nKriging, and compactly supported; covariance functions for large data\nsets. The splines and Kriging methods are; supported by functions that\ncan determine the smoothing parameter; (nugget and sill variance) and\nother covariance function parameters by cross; validation and also by\nrestricted maximum likelihood. For Kriging; there is an easy to use\nfunction that also estimates the correlation; scale (range parameter). A\nmajor feature is that any covariance function; implemented in R and\nfollowing a simple format can be used for; spatial prediction. There are\nalso many useful functions for plotting; and working with spatial data\nas images. This package also contains; an implementation of sparse\nmatrix methods for large spatial data; sets and currently requires the\nsparse matrix (spam) package. Use; help(fields) to get started and for\nan overview. The fields source; code is deliberately commented and\nprovides useful explanations of; numerical details as a companion to the\nmanual pages. The commented; source code can be viewed by expanding the\nsource code version; and looking in the R subdirectory.
