Complex scientific workflows specified by CWL are managed and\nvisualized through a graph database, giving the user the ability to\nmonitor the state of each task in the workflow. BEE runs jobs using the\nworkload scheduler (i.e. Slurm or Flux) on the HPC system that tasks are\nspecified to run on.",
