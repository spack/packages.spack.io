'NIMBLE' extends the 'BUGS'/'JAGS' language\nby making it extensible: New distributions and functions can be added,\nincluding as calls to external compiled code. Although most people think\nof MCMC as the main goal of the 'BUGS'/'JAGS' language for writing\nmodels, one can use 'NIMBLE' for writing arbitrary other kinds of model-\ngeneric algorithms as well.
