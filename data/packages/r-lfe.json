Starting out from the basic robust\nEicker-Huber-White sandwich covariance methods include:\nheteroscedasticity-consistent (HC) covariances for cross-section data;\nheteroscedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) covariances for\ntime series data (such as Andrews' kernel HAC, Newey-West, and WEAVE\nestimators); clustered covariances (one-way and multi-way); panel and\npanel-corrected covariances; outer-product-of-gradients covariances; and\n(clustered) bootstrap covariances. All methods are applicable to\n(generalized) linear model objects fitted by lm() and glm() but can also\nbe adapted to other classes through S3 methods. Details can be found in\nZeileis et al.
