The permutation functions are based on C code from Aaron\nWilliams. Cool-lex order is similar to colexicographical order. The\nalgorithm is described in Williams, A. (2009)\n<DOI:10.1145/1496770.1496877> Loopless Generation of Multiset\nPermutations by Prefix Shifts. Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, New\nYork, United States. The permutation code is distributed without\nrestrictions. The code for stable and efficient computation of\nmultinomial coefficients comes from Dave Barber. The code can be\ndownload from <http://tamivox.org/dave/multinomial/code.html> and is\ndistributed without conditions. The package also generates the integer\npartitions of a positive, non-zero integer n. The C++ code for this is\nbased on Python code from Jerome Kelleher which can be found here\n<https://jeromekelleher.net/tag/integer-partitions.html>. The C++ code\nand Python code are distributed without conditions.\n",
