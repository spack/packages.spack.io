It currently adopts Argobots, a new\nholistic, low-level threading and tasking runtime, in order to overcome\nshortcomings of conventional OS-level threads. The current BOLT\nimplementation is based on the OpenMP runtime in LLVM, and thus it can\nbe used with LLVM/Clang, Intel OpenMP compiler, and GCC.\n",
