The md5\nalgorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1 and sha-256\nalgorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, and the crc32\nalgorithm is described in\nftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. For md5,\nsha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone\nimplementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code\nfrom the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron\nD. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the implementation by Yann Collet is\nused. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used.
