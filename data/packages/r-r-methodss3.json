    "description": "S3 Methods Simplified Methods that simplify the setup of S3 generic\nfunctions and S3 methods. Major effort has been made in making\ndefinition of methods as simple as possible with a minimum of\nmaintenance for package developers. For example, generic functions are\ncreated automatically, if missing, and naming conflict are automatically\nsolved, if possible. The method setMethodS3() is a good start for those\nwho in the future may want to migrate to S4. This is a cross-platform\npackage implemented in pure R that generates standard S3 methods.\n",

With this package, any R object can be cached in a key-\nvalue storage where the key can be an arbitrary set of R objects. The\ncache memory is persistent (on the file system)."
