Carries\nout mapping between assorted color spaces including RGB, HSV, HLS,\nCIEXYZ, CIELUV, HCL (polar CIELUV), CIELAB, and polar CIELAB.\nQualitative, sequential, and diverging color palettes based on HCL\ncolors are provided along with corresponding ggplot2 color scales. Color\npalette choice is aided by an interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a\nshiny graphical user interface) and shiny apps with an HCL color picker\nand a color vision deficiency emulator. Plotting functions for\ndisplaying and assessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations\nof the HCL space, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color\nmanipulation functions include: desaturation, lightening/darkening,\nmixing, and simulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly,\nprotanomaly, tritanomaly).

The second edition includes redesigned graphics and additional\nchapters. The authors emphasize how to construct and interpret graphs,\ndiscuss principles of graphical design, and show how accompanying\ntraditional tabular results are used to confirm the visual impressions\nderived directly from the graphs. Many of the graphical formats are\nnovel and appear here for the first time in print. All chapters have\nexercises. All functions introduced in the book are in the package. R\ncode for all examples, both graphs and tables, in the book is included\nin the scripts directory of the package.",
