Phylogeny estimation can be done with\nthe NJ, BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods, and several methods\nhandling incomplete distance matrices (NJ*, BIONJ*, MVR*, and the\ncorresponding triangle method). Some functions call external\napplications (PhyML, Clustal, T-Coffee, Muscle) whose results are\nreturned into R.",

Started out as\na fork of 'RJSONIO', but has been completely rewritten in recent\nversions. The package offers flexible, robust, high performance tools\nfor working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful for building\npipelines and interacting with a web API. The implementation is based on\nthe mapping described in the vignette (Ooms, 2014). In addition to\nconverting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to\nstream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with\nthe package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded\nconsistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.",

Included among the functions\nin phylogenetic comparative biology are various for ancestral state\nreconstruction, model-fitting, simulation of phylogenies and data, and\nmultivariate analysis. There are a broad range of plotting methods for\nphylogenies and comparative data which include, but are not restricted\nto, methods for mapping trait evolution on trees, for projecting trees\ninto phenotypic space or a geographic map, and for visualizing\ncorrelated speciation between trees. Finally, there are a number of\nfunctions for reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating, and\nmanipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative data not covered by\nother packages. For instance, there are functions for randomly or non-\nrandomly attaching species or clades to a phylogeny, for estimating\nsupertrees or consensus phylogenies from a set, for simulating trees and\nphylogenetic data under a range of models, and for a wide variety of\nother manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic biologists might find\nuseful in their research.",
