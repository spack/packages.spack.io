Manage the life cycle\nof your exported functions with shared conventions, documentation\nbadges, and non-invasive deprecation warnings. The 'lifecycle' package\ndefines four development stages (experimental, maturing, stable, and\nquestioning) and three deprecation stages (soft-deprecated, deprecated,\nand defunct). It makes it easy to insert badges corresponding to these\nstages in your documentation. Usage of deprecated functions are\nsignalled with increasing levels of non-invasive verbosity.\n",
