Data types defined on a\nnetwork include point patterns, pixel images, functions, and\ntessellations.

Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared,\nKolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-\nGenton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-\nBerman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported.\nParametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the function\nlppm() similar to glm(). Only Poisson models are implemented so far.\nModels may involve dependence on covariates and dependence on marks.\nModels are fitted by maximum likelihood. Fitted point process models can\nbe simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model\nare supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo\ntests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC())\nand variable selection (sdr).
