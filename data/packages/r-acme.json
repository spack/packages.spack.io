ACME\n(Algorithms for Calculating Microarray Enrichment) is a set of tools for\nanalysing tiling array ChIP/chip, DNAse hypersensitivity, or other\nexperiments that result in regions of the genome showing \"enrichment\".\nIt does not rely on a specific array technology (although the array\nshould be a \"tiling\" array), is very general (can be applied in\nexperiments resulting in regions of enrichment), and is very insensitive\nto array noise or normalization methods. It is also very fast and can be\napplied on whole-genome tiling array experiments quite easily with\nenough memory.\n",
