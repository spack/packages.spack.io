GTPin allows you\nto capture a range of dynamic profiling data at the finest granularity\nof the specific GPU EU instruction. GTPin supports both compute and\ngraphics workloads. It operates on regular, real-world GPU applications,\nas well as on pre-captured API streams. The technology enables fast and\naccurate dynamic analysis of the code that is executing on the GPU EUs.\nGTPin opens up new opportunities to perform dynamic, low level workload\nand HW analysis on an Intel(R) GPU, with greater efficiency than other\ncurrent solutions. Some of the GTPin capabilities are integrated into\nIntel(R) VTune(TM) Profiler, Intel(R) Advisor, and the Intel(R) Graphics\nPerformance Analyzers (Intel(R) GPA). GTPin is available, along with a\nset of analysis tools based on the GTPin framework. It also enables more\nadvanced users to develop their own analysis tools. GTPin can analyze\nany GPU application.
