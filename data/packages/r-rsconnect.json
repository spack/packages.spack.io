The core of the package implements a framework for\nperforming fully customized requests where data can be processed either\nin memory, on disk, or streaming via the callback or connection\ninterfaces.

The md5\nalgorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1 and sha-256\nalgorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, and the crc32\nalgorithm is described in\nftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. For md5,\nsha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone\nimplementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code\nfrom the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron\nD. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the implementation by Yann Collet is\nused. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used.

In addition to\nconverting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to\nstream, validate, and prettify JSON data.
