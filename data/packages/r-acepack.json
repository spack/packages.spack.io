    "description": "ACE and AVAS for Selecting Multiple Regression Transformations. Two\nnonparametric methods for multiple regression transform selection are\nprovided. The first, Alternative Conditional Expectations (ACE), is an\nalgorithm to find the fixed point of maximal correlation, i.e. it finds\na set of transformed response variables that maximizes R^2 using\nsmoothing functions [see Breiman, L., and J.H. Friedman. 1985.\n\"Estimating Optimal Transformations for Multiple Regression and\nCorrelation\". Journal of the American Statistical Association.\n80:580-598. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1985.10478157>]. Also included is the\nAdditivity Variance Stabilization (AVAS) method which works better than\nACE when correlation is low [see Tibshirani, R.. 1986. \"Estimating\nTransformations for Regression via Additivity and Variance\nStabilization\". Journal of the American Statistical Association.\n83:394-405. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1988.10478610>]. A good introduction\nto these two methods is in chapter 16 of Frank Harrel's \"Regression\nModeling Strategies\" in the Springer Series in Statistics.\n",
