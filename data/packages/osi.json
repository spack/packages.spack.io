    "description": "Osi (Open Solver Interface) provides an abstract base class to a generic\nlinear programming (LP) solver, along with derived classes for specific\nsolvers. Many applications may be able to use the Osi to insulate\nthemselves from a specific LP solver. That is, programs written to the\nOSI standard may be linked to any solver with an OSI interface and\nshould produce correct results. The OSI has been significantly extended\ncompared to its first incarnation. Currently, the OSI supports linear\nprogramming solvers and has rudimentary support for integer programming.\n",
