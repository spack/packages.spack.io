Fewer differences between graph processing\nevaluations will make it easier to compare different research efforts\nand quantify improvements. The benchmark not only specifies graph\nkernels, input graphs, and evaluation methodologies, but it also\nprovides an optimized baseline implementation (this repo). These\nbaseline implementations are representative of state-of-the-art\nperformance, and thus new contributions should outperform them to\ndemonstrate an improvement.\n",
