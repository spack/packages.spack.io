The project initially aimed for a minimalistic implementation\nof the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm, focusing on simplicity in\nfeatures, dependencies, and code style. Although it has expanded in\nterms of features, it remains minimalistic by relying only on the numpy\nlibrary and emphasizing vectorization in coding style.",
