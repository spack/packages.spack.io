    "description": "Core Functionality of the 'spatstat' Family. Functionality for data\nanalysis and modelling of spatial data, mainly spatial point patterns,\nin the 'spatstat' family of packages. (Excludes analysis of spatial data\non a linear network, which is covered by the separate package\n'spatstat.linnet'.) Exploratory methods include quadrat counts,\nK-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance\nand empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation function, kernel\nsmoothed intensity, relative risk estimation with cross-validated\nbandwidth selection, mark correlation functions, segregation indices,\nmark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects.\nFormal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-\nstage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-\nLawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported. Parametric models\ncan be fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(),\nslrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs\nand Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and\ndeterminantal point processes. Models may involve dependence on\ncovariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and dependence on\nmarks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression,\nminimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods. A model can be\nfitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using\nthe function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed\neffects depending on the experimental design, in addition to all the\nfeatures listed above. Fitted point process models can be simulated,\nautomatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported\n(likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along\nwith basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()) and variable\nselection (sdr). Tools for validating the fitted model include\nsimulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage\nand influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added variable plots.\n",
