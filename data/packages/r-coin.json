The core of the package is ctree(), an\nimplementation of conditional inference trees which embed tree-\nstructured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional\ninference procedures. This non-parametric class of regression trees is\napplicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal,\nordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables\nand arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Based on conditional\ninference trees, cforest() provides an implementation of Breiman's\nrandom forests. The function mob() implements an algorithm for recursive\npartitioning based on parametric models (e.g. linear models, GLMs or\nsurvival regression) employing parameter instability tests for split\nselection. Extensible functionality for visualizing tree-structured\nregression models is available. The methods are described in Hothorn et\nal. (2006) <doi:10.1198/106186006X133933>, Zeileis et al.
