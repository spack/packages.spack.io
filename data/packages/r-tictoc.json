One can record all timings while a complex\nscript is running, and examine the values later. It is also possible to\ninstrument the timing calls with custom callbacks. In addition, this\npackage provides class 'Stack', implemented as a vector, and class\n'List', implemented as a list, both of which support operations 'push',\n'pop', 'first', 'last' and 'clear'.\n",
