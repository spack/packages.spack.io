It includes two complementary\nprograms. BreakDancerMax predicts five types of structural variants:\ninsertions, deletions, inversions, inter- and intra-chromosomal\ntranslocations from next-generation short paired-end sequencing reads\nusing read pairs that are mapped with unexpected separation distances or\norientation. BreakDancerMini focuses on detecting small indels (usually\nbetween 10bp and 100bp) using normally mapped read pairs..",
