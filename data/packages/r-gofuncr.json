Additional functions\nprovided in this package like 'get_expression' and 'plot_expression'\nfacilitate exploring the expression data, and besides the standard\ncandidate vs. background gene set enrichment, also three additional\ntests are implemented, e.g. for cases when genes are ranked instead of\ndivided into candidate and background.",

GOfuncR provides the standard candidate\nvs. background enrichment analysis using the hypergeometric test, as\nwell as three additional tests: (i) the Wilcoxon rank-sum test that is\nused when genes are ranked, (ii) a binomial test that is used when genes\nare associated with two counts and (iii) a Chi-square or Fisher's exact\ntest that is used in cases when genes are associated with four counts.\nTo correct for multiple testing and interdependency of the tests,\nfamily-wise error rates are computed based on random permutations of the\ngene-associated variables. GOfuncR also provides tools for exploring the\nontology graph and the annotations, and options to take gene-length or\nspatial clustering of genes into account. It is also possible to provide\ncustom gene coordinates, annotations and ontologies.\n",
