It also implements original multivariate\nmethods (DAPC, sPCA), graphics, statistical tests, simulation tools,\ndistance and similarity measures, and several spatial methods. A range\nof both empirical and simulated datasets is also provided to illustrate\nvarious methods.",

Phylogeny estimation can be done with\nthe NJ, BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods, and several methods\nhandling incomplete distance matrices (NJ*, BIONJ*, MVR*, and the\ncorresponding triangle method). Some functions call external\napplications (PhyML, Clustal, T-Coffee, Muscle) whose results are\nreturned into R.",
