    "description": "Expanded Replacement and Extension of the 'optim' Function. Provides a\nreplacement and extension of the optim() function to call to several\nfunction minimization codes in R in a single statement. These methods\nhandle smooth, possibly box constrained functions of several or many\nparameters. Note that function 'optimr()' was prepared to simplify the\nincorporation of minimization codes going forward. Also implements some\nutility codes and some extra solvers, including safeguarded Newton\nmethods. Many methods previously separate are now included here. This is\nthe version for CRAN.\n",

Accurate\ncalculations are done using 'Richardson\"s' extrapolation or, when\napplicable, a complex step derivative is available. A simple difference\nmethod is also provided. Simple difference is (usually) less accurate\nbut is much quicker than 'Richardson\"s' extrapolation and provides a\nuseful cross-check. Methods are provided for real scalar and vector\nvalued functions."
