Once these\nclassifiers have been trained, they can be used to predict on new data.\nAlso, cross validation estimation of the error can be done. Since\nversion 2.0 the function margins() is available to calculate the margins\nfor these classifiers. Also a higher flexibility is achieved giving\naccess to the rpart.control() argument of 'rpart'. Four important new\nfeatures were introduced on version 3.0, AdaBoost-SAMME (Zhu et al.,\n2009) is implemented and a new function errorevol() shows the error of\nthe ensembles as a function of the number of iterations. In addition,\nthe ensembles can be pruned using the option 'newmfinal' in the\npredict.bagging() and predict.boosting() functions and the posterior\nprobability of each class for observations can be obtained. Version 3.1\nmodifies the relative importance measure to take into account the gain\nof the Gini index given by a variable in each tree and the weights of\nthese trees. Version 4.0 includes the margin-based ordered aggregation\nfor Bagging pruning (Guo and Boukir, 2013) and a function to auto prune\nthe 'rpart' tree. Moreover, three new plots are also available\nimportanceplot(), plot.errorevol() and plot.margins(). Version 4.1\nallows to predict on unlabeled data. Version 4.2 includes the parallel\ncomputation option for some of the functions."
