In addition,\nthe ensembles can be pruned using the option 'newmfinal' in the\npredict.bagging() and predict.boosting() functions and the posterior\nprobability of each class for observations can be obtained. Version 3.1\nmodifies the relative importance measure to take into account the gain\nof the Gini index given by a variable in each tree and the weights of\nthese trees. Version 4.0 includes the margin-based ordered aggregation\nfor Bagging pruning (Guo and Boukir, 2013) and a function to auto prune\nthe 'rpart' tree.
