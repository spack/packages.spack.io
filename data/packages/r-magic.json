It runs in\n2D, 3D, 4D, and higher dimensions. It implements the Quickhull algorithm\nfor computing the convex hull.

A collection of efficient,\nvectorized algorithms for the creation and investigation of magic\nsquares and hypercubes, including a variety of functions for the\nmanipulation and analysis of arbitrarily dimensioned arrays.

The ultimate intention is for the package to be a computerized\nembodiment all magic square knowledge, including direct numerical\nverification of properties of magic squares (such as recent results on\nthe determinant of odd-ordered semimagic squares). Some antimagic\nfunctionality is included. The package also serves as a rebuttal to the\noften-heard comment \"I thought R was just for statistics\".\n",
