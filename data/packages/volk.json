    "description": "VOLK is the Vector-Optimized Library of Kernels. It is a library that\ncontains kernels of hand-written SIMD code for different mathematical\noperations. Since each SIMD architecture can be very different and no\ncompiler has yet come along to handle vectorization properly or highly\nefficiently, VOLK approaches the problem differently. For each\narchitecture or platform that a developer wishes to vectorize for, a new\nproto-kernel is added to VOLK. At runtime, VOLK will select the correct\nproto-kernel. In this way, the users of VOLK call a kernel for\nperforming the operation that is platform/architecture agnostic. This\nallows us to write portable SIMD code.\n",
