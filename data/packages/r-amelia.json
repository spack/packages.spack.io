    "description": "A Program for Missing Data. A tool that \"multiply imputes\" missing data\nin a single cross-section (such as a survey), from a time series (like\nvariables collected for each year in a country), or from a time-series-\ncross-sectional data set (such as collected by years for each of several\ncountries). Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that\ngives essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis\napproaches, is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and\ncan handle many more variables. Unlike Amelia I and other statistically\nrigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please let\nus know if you find to the contrary!). The program also generalizes\nexisting approaches by allowing for trends in time series across\nobservations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors that allow\nexperts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values of missing\ncells in their data. Amelia II also includes useful diagnostics of the\nfit of multiple imputation models. The program works from the R command\nline or via a graphical user interface that does not require users to\nknow R.\n",
