    "description": "Parametric Bootstrap, Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite Based Methods for\nTest in Mixed Models Test in mixed effects models. Attention is on mixed\neffects models as implemented in the 'lme4' package. For linear mixed\nmodels, this package implements (1) a parametric bootstrap test, (2) a\nKenward-Roger-typ modification of F-tests for linear mixed effects\nmodels and (3) a Satterthwaite-type modification of F-tests for linear\nmixed effects models. The package also implements a parametric bootstrap\ntest for generalized linear mixed models. The facilities of the package\nare documented in the paper by Halehoh and Hojsgaard, (2012,\n<doi:10.18637/jss.v059.i09>). Please see 'citation(\"pbkrtest\")' for\ncitation details.\n",
