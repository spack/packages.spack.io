The package includes functions to\ncalculate various effect sizes or outcome measures, fit equal-, fixed-,\nrandom-, and mixed-effects models to such data, carry out moderator and\nmeta-regression analyses, and create various types of meta-analytical\nplots (e.g., forest, funnel, radial, L'Abbe, Baujat, bubble, and GOSH\nplots). For meta-analyses of binomial and person-time data, the package\nalso provides functions that implement specialized methods, including\nthe Mantel-Haenszel method, Peto's method, and a variety of suitable\ngeneralized linear (mixed-effects) models (i.e., mixed-effects logistic\nand Poisson regression models). Finally, the package provides\nfunctionality for fitting meta-analytic multivariate/multilevel models\nthat account for non-independent sampling errors and/or true effects\n(e.g., due to the inclusion of multiple treatment studies, multiple\nendpoints, or other forms of clustering). Network meta-analyses and\nmeta-analyses accounting for known correlation structures (e.g., due to\nphylogenetic relatedness) can also be conducted. An introduction to the\npackage can be found in Viechtbauer (2010) <doi:10.18637/jss.v036.i03>.",
