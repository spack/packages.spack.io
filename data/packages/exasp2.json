    "description": "ExaSP2 is a reference implementation of typical linear algebra\nalgorithms and workloads for a quantum molecular dynamics (QMD)\nelectronic structure code. The algorithm is based on a recursive second-\norder Fermi-Operator expansion method (SP2) and is tailored for density\nfunctional based tight-binding calculations of material systems. The SP2\nalgorithm variants are part of the Los Alamos Transferable Tight-binding\nfor Energetics (LATTE) code, based on a matrix expansion of the Fermi\noperator in a recursive series of generalized matrix-matrix\nmultiplications. It is created and maintained by Co-Design Center for\nParticle Applications (CoPA). The code is intended to serve as a vehicle\nfor co-design by allowing others to extend and/or reimplement as needed\nto test performance of new architectures, programming models, etc.\n",
