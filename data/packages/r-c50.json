This unified infrastructure can be used for\nreading/coercing tree models from different sources ('rpart', 'RWeka',\n'PMML') yielding objects that share functionality for\nprint()/plot()/predict() methods. Furthermore, new and improved\nreimplementations of conditional inference trees (ctree()) and model-\nbased recursive partitioning (mob()) from the 'party' package are\nprovided based on the new infrastructure. A description of this package\nwas published by Hothorn and Zeileis (2015)\n<https://jmlr.org/papers/v16/hothorn15a.html>."
