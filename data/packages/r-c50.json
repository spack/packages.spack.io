The NVIDIA HPC SDK C, C++, and\nFortran compilers support GPU acceleration of HPC modeling and\nsimulation applications with standard C++ and Fortran, OpenACC\ndirectives, and CUDA. GPU-accelerated math libraries maximize\nperformance on common HPC algorithms, and optimized communications\nlibraries enable standards-based multi-GPU and scalable systems\nprogramming.

Furthermore, new and improved\nreimplementations of conditional inference trees (ctree()) and model-\nbased recursive partitioning (mob()) from the 'party' package are\nprovided based on the new infrastructure.
