The algorithm uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-\nwise fashion, as described in the paper linked to via the URL below.\n",

In that sense, it is similar to the\nstandard lapply function, but doesn't require the evaluation of a\nfunction. Using foreach without side effects also facilitates executing\nthe loop in parallel."
