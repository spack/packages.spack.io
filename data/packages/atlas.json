Xyce supplies industry-standard\ncompact models and can support custom models via its Verilog-A model\ncompiler. Foundry process-development kits (PDKs) in other SPICE syntax\ncan be used via the XDM netlist translator, which is included as part of\nthe Xyce package. In addition to supporting use on all common desktop\nplatforms (Mac, Windows, Linux), Xyce can also be compiled to run in a\nlarge-scale parallel mode to provide scalable, numerically accurate\nanalog simulation of circuits containing millions of devices, or more.",
