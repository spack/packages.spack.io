    "description": "A fork of frozendict, an immutable wrapper around dictionaries. It\nimplements the complete mapping interface and can be used as a drop-in\nreplacement for dictionaries where immutability is desired. The\nimmutabledict constructor mimics dict, and all of the expected\ninterfaces (iter, len, repr, hash, getitem) are provided. Note that an\nimmutabledict does not guarantee the immutability of its values, so the\nutility of hash method is restricted by usage. The only difference is\nthat the copy() method of immutable takes variable keyword arguments,\nwhich will be present as key/value pairs in the new, immutable copy.\n",
