'Eigen' is a C++ template library\nfor linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers and related\nalgorithms.

Its performance on many algorithms is\ncomparable with some of the best implementations based on 'Lapack' and\nlevel-3 'BLAS'. The 'RcppEigen' package includes the header files from\nthe 'Eigen' C++ template library (currently version 3.2.8). Thus users\ndo not need to install 'Eigen' itself in order to use 'RcppEigen'.
