'PopVar' contains a set of functions that use phenotypic and\ngenotypic data from a set of candidate parents to 1) predict the mean,\ngenetic variance, and superior progeny value of all, or a defined set of\npairwise bi-parental crosses, and 2) perform cross-validation to\nestimate genome-wide prediction accuracy of multiple statistical models.\nMore details are available in Mohammadi, Tiede, and Smith (2015,\n<doi:10.2135/cropsci2015.01.0030>).
