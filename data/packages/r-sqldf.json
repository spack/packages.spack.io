The package also has facilities\nfor translating formulas to functions and allowing such formulas in\nfunction calls instead of functions. This can be used with R functions\nsuch as apply, sapply, lapply, optim, integrate, xyplot, Filter and any\nother function that expects another function as an input argument or\nfunctions like cat or sql calls that may involve strings where\nsubstitution is desirable.",

The sqldf() function is typically\npassed a single argument which is an SQL select statement where the\ntable names are ordinary R data frame names. sqldf() transparently sets\nup a database, imports the data frames into that database, performs the\nSQL select or other statement and returns the result using a heuristic\nto determine which class to assign to each column of the returned data\nframe. The sqldf() or read.csv.sql() functions can also be used to read\nfiltered files into R even if the original files are larger than R\nitself can handle. 'RSQLite', 'RH2', 'RMySQL' and 'RPostgreSQL' backends\nare supported.\n",
