    "description": "Dispersion shrinkage for sequencing data DSS is an R library performing\ndifferntial analysis for count-based sequencing data. It detectes\ndifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) from RNA-seq, and differentially\nmethylated loci or regions (DML/DMRs) from bisulfite sequencing (BS-\nseq). The core of DSS is a new dispersion shrinkage method for\nestimating the dispersion parameter from Gamma-Poisson or Beta-Binomial\ndistributions.\n",

In order to\nreduce memory usage and optimize performance, operations on the object\nare either delayed or executed using a block processing mechanism. Note\nthat this also works on in-memory array-like objects like DataFrame\nobjects (typically with Rle columns), Matrix objects, and ordinary\narrays and data frames."
