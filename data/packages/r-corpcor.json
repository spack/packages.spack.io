    "description": "Efficient Estimation of Covariance and (Partial) Correlation. Implements\na James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator for the covariance matrix, with\nseparate shrinkage for variances and correlations. The details of the\nmethod are explained in Schafer and Strimmer (2005)\n<DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1175> and Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007)\n<DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1252>. The approach is both computationally as\nwell as statistically very efficient, it is applicable to \"small n,\nlarge p\" data, and always returns a positive definite and well-\nconditioned covariance matrix. In addition to inferring the covariance\nmatrix the package also provides shrinkage estimators for partial\ncorrelations and partial variances. The inverse of the covariance and\ncorrelation matrix can be efficiently computed, as well as any arbitrary\npower of the shrinkage correlation matrix. Furthermore, functions are\navailable for fast singular value decomposition, for computing the\npseudoinverse, and for checking the rank and positive definiteness of a\nmatrix.\n",
