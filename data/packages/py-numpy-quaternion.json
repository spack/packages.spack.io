    "description": "This package creates a quaternion type in python, and further enables\nnumpy to create and manipulate arrays of quaternions. The usual\nalgebraic operations (addition and multiplication) are available, along\nwith numerous properties like norm and various types of distance\nmeasures between two quaternions. There are also additional functions\nlike \"squad\" and \"slerp\" interpolation, and conversions to and from\naxis-angle, matrix, and Euler-angle representations of rotations. The\ncore of the code is written in C for speed.\n",
