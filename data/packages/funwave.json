    "description": " What is FUNWAVE-TVD? FUNWAVE-TVD is the Total Variation Diminishing\n(TVD) version of the fully nonlinear Boussinesq wave model (FUNWAVE)\ndeveloped by Shi et al. (2012). The FUNWAVE model was initially\ndeveloped by Kirby et al. (1998) based on Wei et al. (1995). The\ndevelopment of the present version was motivated by recent needs for\nmodeling of surfzone--cale optical properties in a Boussinesq model\nframework, and modeling of Tsunami waves in both a global/coastal scale\nfor prediction of coastal inundation and a basin scale for wave\npropagation.\n",
