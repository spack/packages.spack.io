The description of the tracking detector's geometry\nis optimized for efficient navigation and quick extrapolation of tracks.\nConverters for several common geometry description languages exist.\nHaving a highly performant, yet largely customizable implementation of\ntrack reconstruction algorithms was a primary objective for the design\nof this toolset. Additionally, the applicability to real-life HEP\nexperiments plays major role in the development process. Apart from\nalgorithmic code, this project also provides an event data model for the\ndescription of track parameters and measurements. Key features of this\nproject include: tracking geometry description which can be constructed\nfrom TGeo, DD4Hep, or GDML input, simple and efficient event data model,\nperformant and highly flexible algorithms for track propagation and\nfitting, basic seed finding algorithms."

Verilator supports the\nsynthesis subset of Verilog, plus initial statements, proper\nblocking/non-blocking assignments, functions, tasks, multi-dimensional\narrays, and signed numbers. It also supports very simple forms of\nSystemVerilog assertions and coverage analysis. Verilator supports the\nmore important Verilog 2005 constructs, and some SystemVerilog features,\nwith additional constructs being added as users request them.

AOCL-Compression supports\nlz4, zlib/deflate, lzma, zstd, bzip2, snappy, and lz4hc based\ncompression and decompression methods along with their native APIs. The\nlibrary offers openMP based multi-threaded implementation of lz4, zlib,\nzstd and snappy compression methods. It supports the dynamic dispatcher\nfeature that executes the most optimal function variant implemented\nusing Function Multi-versioning thereby offering a single optimized\nlibrary portable across different x86 CPU architectures. AOCL-\nCompression framework is developed in C for UNIX\u00ae and Windows\u00ae based\nsystems. A test suite is provided for the validation and performance\nbenchmarking of the supported compression and decompression methods.\nThis suite also supports the benchmarking of IPP compression methods,\nsuch as, lz4, lz4hc, zlib and bzip2. The library build framework offers\nCTest based testing of the test cases implemented using GTest and the\nlibrary test suite.
