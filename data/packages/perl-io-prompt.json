MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to\na genome, produces ab-initio gene predictions and automatically\nsynthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based\nquality values. MAKER is also easily trainable: outputs of preliminary\nruns can be used to automatically retrain its gene prediction algorithm,\nproducing higher quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs\nare minimal and its ouputs can be directly loaded into a GMOD database.\nThey can also be viewed in the Apollo genome browser; this feature of\nMAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view and edit individual\ncontigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. MAKER should prove\nespecially useful for emerging model organism projects with minimal\nbioinformatics expertise and computer resources. Note: MAKER requires\nregistration.

    "description": "By default, this module exports a single function prompt. It prompts the\nuser to enter some input, and returns an object that represents the user\ninput. You may specify various flags to the function to affect its\nbehaviour; most notably, it defaults to automatically chomp the input,\nunless the -line flag is specified. Two other functions are exported at\nrequest: hand_print, which simulates hand-typing to the console; and\nget_input, which is the lower-level function that actually prompts the\nuser for a suitable input. Note that this is an interim re-release. A\nfull release with better documentation will follow in the near future.\nMeanwhile, please consult the examples directory from this module's CPAN\ndistribution to better understand how to make use of this module.\n",
