ROC graphs,\nsensitivity/specificity curves, lift charts, and precision/recall plots\nare popular examples of trade-off visualizations for specific pairs of\nperformance measures. ROCR is a flexible tool for creating cutoff-\nparameterized 2D performance curves by freely combining two from over 25\nperformance measures (new performance measures can be added using a\nstandard interface). Curves from different cross-validation or\nbootstrapping runs can be averaged by different methods, and standard\ndeviations, standard errors or box plots can be used to visualize the\nvariability across the runs. The parameterization can be visualized by\nprinting cutoff values at the corresponding curve positions, or by\ncoloring the curve according to cutoff. All components of a performance\nplot can be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching\nmechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to use, with only three\ncommands and reasonable default values for all optional parameters.",
