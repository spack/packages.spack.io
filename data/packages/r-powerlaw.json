            "description": "Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models. An implementation of\nabout 6 major classes of statistical regression models. The central\nalgorithm is Fisher scoring and iterative reweighted least squares. At\nthe heart of this package are the vector generalized linear and additive\nmodel (VGLM/VGAM) classes. VGLMs can be loosely thought of as\nmultivariate GLMs. VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs that use smoothing. The\nbook \"Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models: With an\nImplementation in R\" (Yee, 2015) <DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7> gives\ndetails of the statistical framework and the package. Currently only\nfixed-effects models are implemented. Many (150+) models and\ndistributions are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or\npenalized MLE. The other classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs),\nquadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column interaction\nmodels)---these classes perform constrained and unconstrained quadratic\nordination (CQO/UQO) models in ecology, as well as constrained additive\nordination (CAO). Hauck-Donner effect detection is implemented. Note\nthat these functions are subject to change; see the NEWS and ChangeLog\nfiles for latest changes.",
