    "description": "This project provides classes and utility functions for working with\nread fast5 files. It provides an abstraction layer between the\nunderlying h5py library and the various concepts central to read fast5\nfiles, such as \"reads\", \"analyses\", \"analysis summaries\", and \"analysis\ndatasets\". Ideally all interaction with a read fast5 file should be\npossible via this API, without having to directly invoke the h5py\nlibrary.\n",
