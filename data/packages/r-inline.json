The Stan\nproject develops a probabilistic programming language that implements\nfull Bayesian statistical inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo, rough\nBayesian inference via variational approximation, and (optionally\npenalized) maximum likelihood estimation via optimization. In all three\ncases, automatic differentiation is used to quickly and accurately\nevaluate gradients without burdening the user with the need to derive\nthe partial derivatives.",
