It is intended to provide FOSS replacement functions for\nthe ACM licensed akima::interp and tripack::tri.mesh functions. Linear\ninterpolation is implemented in interp::interp(..., method=\"linear\"),\nthis corresponds to the call akima::interp(..., linear=TRUE) which is\nthe default setting and covers most of akima::interp use cases in\ndepending packages. A re-implementation of Akimas irregular grid spline\ninterpolation (akima::interp(..., linear=FALSE)) is now also available\nvia interp::interp(..., method=\"akima\"). Estimators for partial\nderivatives are now also available in interp::locpoly(), these are a\nprerequisite for the spline interpolation. The basic part is a GPLed\ntriangulation algorithm (sweep hull algorithm by David Sinclair)\nproviding the starting point for the irregular grid interpolator. As\nside effect this algorithm is also used to provide replacements for\nalmost all functions of the tripack package which also suffers from the\nsame ACM license restrictions. All functions are designed to be backward\ncompatible with their akima / tripack counterparts.",
