    "description": "Regression Modeling Strategies Regression modeling, testing, estimation,\nvalidation, graphics, prediction, and typesetting by storing enhanced\nmodel design attributes in the fit. 'rms' is a collection of functions\nthat assist with and streamline modeling. It also contains functions for\nbinary and ordinal logistic regression models, ordinal models for\ncontinuous Y with a variety of distribution families, and the Buckley-\nJames multiple regression model for right-censored responses, and\nimplements penalized maximum likelihood estimation for logistic and\nordinary linear models. 'rms' works with almost any regression model,\nbut it was especially written to work with binary or ordinal regression\nmodels, Cox regression, accelerated failure time models, ordinary linear\nmodels, the Buckley-James model, generalized least squares for serially\nor spatially correlated observations, generalized linear models, and\nquantile regression.\n",
